      "\n",
      "In 1970, I decided to specialize in healthcare design. I spent many weeks at the library researching the literature on medical and dental space planning, color and its effect on patients, and the psychological aspects of illness — how do patients and visitors react to hospitals? Why do people fear a visit to the doctor or dentist? What role does lighting play in patient rooms?\n",
      "\n",
      "Much to my surprise, very little had been written on these topics. I found nothing in architecture or design publications, but did come across an occasional article in obscure publications sometimes dating from the 1940s. There were a few articles in the American Journal of Occupational Therapy on the effect of the environment on the patient, and there were numerous articles on color preferences of various ethnic groups or cultural taboos with respect to color. A handful of articles on limited aspects of office space planning were scattered in medical or dental practice management magazines and Department of Health, Education, and Welfare publications. Here was a field with few resources and vast potential.\n",
      "\n",
      "Most medical and dental offices in 1970 were either colorless and clinical or drab and dreary. There was no middle ground. Clinical offices had high levels of illumination, easy-to-clean shiny surfaces, and a lot of medical or dental instruments in view — clean and clinical. At the other end of the spectrum were offices with brown shag carpeting, residential pendant lights, nubby, earth-tone upholstery fabric that wouldn’t show soil, and poorly styled wood furniture that appeared to have been rescued from a Salvation Army truck. Dusty pothos plants in macrame hangers complete the picture of these dingy and unhygienic environments.\n",
      "\n",
      "Token Chunk 7: I concluded that I would have to do my own empirical research to gather enough data on which to base my design work. I spent the better part of a year visiting hospitals, interviewing staff and patients, and observing how patients were handled. I wanted to see the facility through the patients’ eyes. I also visited many physicians and dentists and asked about their practices — what kinds of instruments they used; what size treatment room would be optimal; what kinds of changes would make their offices more efficient; and what critical adjacencies existed between rooms or treatment areas.\n",
      "\n",
      "I documented my visits with photographs of confusing signage, waiting rooms furnished with Goodwill rejects, dismal lighting, corridors jammed with medical equipment, and procedure rooms that resembled Dr. Jekyll’s laboratory. At the end of my research, I had accumulated over 2000 photos and reams of notes, which I analyzed, and, from this, I formulated my design philosophy. My dual majors, Psychology and Environmental Design, provided a theoretical background with which to interpret the data. This database, combined with my current 30 years of experience designing hundreds of medical and dental offices, has resulted in this book.\n",
      "\n",
      "Token Chunk 8: A person with no prior experience in healthcare design can study this book and become familiar not only with current economic and practice management issues, but also with medical and dental procedures, equipment associated with each medical or dental specialty, room sizes, traffic flow, construction methods, codes, interior finishes, and more. I have attempted to synthesize my research and experience so that others will not have to follow such a laborious course of study in order to become proficient in a field that requires such highly specialized knowledge.\n",
      "---\n",
      "Today, probably more than a thousand architects and designers across the country list healthcare as one of their specialties. In its infancy when I started out, the field has now reached maturity. No longer concerned with discovering the basic rules and principles, healthcare design specialists can devote themselves to refining what has been learned and to innovation.\n",
      "\n",
      "The first edition of this book was published in 1982 and featured exclusively my own work. However, the second edition (1990) and the new third edition, in order to give a broader perspective, include examples of work by other practitioners, who are credited under each photo. I thank each of these architects, designers, and photographers for sharing their work.\n",
      "\n",
      "The third edition updates the book on digital technology — electronic medical records, digital imaging, digital diagnostic instruments, and networked communications — and how these impact the design of medical and dental offices. The milieu in which physicians and dentists practice—the impact of managed care, the Internet, the baby boomer generation, the age wave, the large number of uninsured Americans — is presented as a backdrop for understanding the pressures on the healthcare system and, also, implications for facility design.\n",
      "\n",
      "Token Chunk 9: Expanded chapters include new medical specialties: reproductive enhancement (in vitro fertilization), pain management, breast care centers, LASIK eye surgery, and medical oncology. Nowhere have changes in technology been more apparent than in dentistry and diagnostic imaging. These and most other chapters have been totally rewritten. Nearly 100 new or revised space plans, totally revised space programs for all specialties, and 90 percent new photos of facilities and equipment have been added to all chapters, and the text has been rewritten to include new developments in medical and dental treatment and to familiarize readers with state-of-the-art medical and dental equipment. Fabrics and interior finishes representative of recent technological advances are introduced as well as ergonomically appropriate furniture. The lighting chapter has been revised to acquaint readers with new types of lamps and fixtures and innovative solutions to enhance both aesthetics and function.\n",
      "\n",
      "Token Chunk 10: A major change since the last edition of this book is the rigor of regulatory agency review of office-based surgery practices, far more stringent mandatory regulation (certification, licensing, and accreditation) of ambulatory surgical centers, and interest by group practices and large managed-care organizations in seeking voluntary accreditation from one or more national agencies as well as Medicare certification. Ambulatory-care enterprises such as a breast care center, urgent care, women’s center, or radiation therapy that may physically be located in a medical office building but are covered under the hospital’s license, will most likely be subject to a JCAHO survey and accreditation. This book will help clarify the roles of these various agencies, explain which aspects of the regulations apply to the built environment, and answer many questions that often arise when trying to understand compliance. I’ve also tried to clarify OSHA issues that affect design, which required wading through several inches of “interpretive letters” to find those kernels that impacted safety of personnel and were within the province of design professionals as opposed to policies and procedures followed by staff to protect themselves.\n",
      "\n",
      "I offer special thanks to my colleagues, architect Bill Yeaple, Ph.D., for his invaluable assistance in research and in acquiring updated photos of equipment; and architects Osia Orailoglu; Joost Bende, AIA; and Chris Shinall for their assistance in updating space plans; and to my executive assistant, Mary Anne Jones, for her extraordinary help and perseverance in preparing the manuscript. I would also like to thank the AIA Academy of Architecture for Health for providing me with an advance draft of the new Guidelines for Design and Construction of Hospital and Health Care Facilities, chapter on ambulatory care.\n",
      "\n",
      "Token Chunk 11: On a final note, although the book attempts to familiarize readers with basic code information, codes vary geographically and the architect or designer must check local and state codes, as well as the evolution of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) legislation.\n",

      "Dramatic changes have occurred in the delivery of healthcare since the first edition of this book when undiscounted fee-for-service reigned. The seminal event that kicked off a series of radical changes in the traditional fee structure began in 1984, with the federal government’s prospective pricing program whereby Medicare and Medicaid reimbursements were made on a fixed, flat-fee basis, rather than as a percentage of an individual physician’s fee. Based upon a current list of 500 diagnosis-related groups (DRGs) of procedures, the physician/provider receives a flat fee, regardless of actual cost. Each DRG has a “weight” established for it based primarily on Medicare billing and cost data. Each weight reflects the relative cost, across all hospitals, of treating cases classified in that DRG. Since Medicare and Medicaid comprise approximately 33 percent of the national healthcare budget, hospitals and physicians have been forced to take a hard look at ways to reduce costs. Following the lead of the federal government, some states also have initiated prospective pricing programs, and insurance companies have followed suit, issuing guidelines and directives, and making physicians feel that third-party payers, rather than they, are managing their patients’ care.\n",
      "\n",
      "Token Chunk 12: During the 1990s, the demands of investors increasingly influenced the delivery of healthcare services as a growing number of hospitals, home healthcare services, skilled nursing facilities, and HMOs (health maintenance organizations) became for-profit entities, publicly traded on Wall Street. Investor ownership profoundly influenced the “product” of healthcare by intensifying competition, creating a focus on cost containment, reducing the autonomy of physicians, and, ultimately, reducing healthcare services to a commodity. But by 1997, healthcare stocks were performing poorly because cost containment and competition had reduced profit margins and Medicare and Medicaid had made serious budget cuts. Then came the scandals leading to the collapse of two of the most celebrated companies — Columbia/HCA and Oxford Health Plans.\n",
      "\n",
      "Just when healthcare finance seemed as if it couldn’t get any worse, it did. The Balanced Budget Act of 1997 required that Medicare expenditures be cut by $115 billion over a period of five years, placing enormous pressure on hospitals to reduce costs.\n",
      "\n",
      "On the insurance front, the biggest change over the past five years has been the growth of HMO enrollment from 50.6 million Americans in 1995 to 80.9 million in 2000; however, this trend is slowing. A more detailed discussion of HMOs and market penetration can be found in Chapter 6, and an excellent financial summary of the American healthcare system in the 1990s is available in The New England Journal of Medicine. According to this article, in 1997, only about one-third of HMOs recorded a profit, since they faced considerable competition from each other and from physician-owned health plans and those sponsored by hospitals. Additionally, consumer dissatisfaction with restrictions on care and a rash of bad press has led to a proliferation of managed care alternatives, and in Washington, patients’ rights legislation looks as if it may pass in the 2001 Congress.\n",
      "\n",
      "Token Chunk 13: Although some states have remained relatively unaffected by managed care and physicians in those states are doing well with discounted fee-for-service reimbursement, physicians in states like California, Rhode Island, Delaware, Hawaii, and Pennsylvania — those with the\n",

This has led physicians into durable medical equipment will be. Imposed by HCFA (Healthcare Financing Administration) in August 2000, APCs will affect ambulatory surgery, which has become a battleground between physicians and hospitals. Seventy percent of all surgery is done in an outpatient setting.4 Today, medical insurance is complicated and has become a battleground wherein healthcare providers, consumers, employers, and insurance companies are each trying to retain control of their respective interests. The less complex (and more lucrative) cases are siphoned off by physicians to be performed in an ambulatory surgical center, while the hospital is left with complex cases and declining reimbursement.\n",
      "\n",
      "Token Chunk 14: Whether healthcare will ever be “reformed” to include the uninsured and to fulfill the original promise of managed care — to provide closely integrated services, eliminating waste, and enhancing clinical outcomes – remains unclear. The ever-shifting sands of healthcare politics reveal, however, a certain sensitivity to public opinion. Recent announcements by Blue Cross and other large payers promise to allow physicians to make the final decision on treatments for their patients. And some have further proposed to reward physicians with bonuses for receiving high patient satisfaction scores as opposed to rewarding them for restricting access and containing costs.

But if the research published in the past few years is any indication, this trend will accelerate, not diminish. From the physician’s perspective, valuable examination time can be squandered by having to sort through a stack of studies that may or may not be relevant to the patient’s condition.

      "\n",
      "A visit to the physician or dentist traumatizes many people. The basis for the fear, even more than lack of familiarity with procedures and a feeling of helplessness, may stem from the perception of invasion of one’s personal space. Touch and proximity can be comforting elements in other cultures, whereas Americans maintain larger territorial boundaries. For example, an American may maintain an imaginary barrier 24 inches in front of him or her as a safe conversational distance for strangers, while a person from the Middle East may reduce that safe boundary to 12 inches.\n",
      "\n",
      "During a medical or dental examination, a person is most vulnerable, both emotionally and physically. One’s territorial limits are invaded by strangers who poke, probe, and prod. And when the examination demands that the patient be naked, clad only in a gown, even the barrier of clothing ceases to protect. Is it any wonder that a visit to the dentist or physician can intimidate even the most stouthearted among us? How, then, can practitioners break through this barrier to examine and treat patients without arousing fear and anxiety? First, the patient must perceive the positive aspects of the care he or she is receiving through an understanding of the procedures and how they will enhance his or her enjoyment of life. The relief of pain and the prevention of disease are joys in themselves. Second, the diagnostic and therapeutic milieu must promote health rather than aggravate illness and cause anxiety. The environment must be clean, cheerful, and nonthreatening, with contemporary furnishings, pleasing colors, interesting textures, and compatible works of art. The staff should be neatly groomed, well trained, friendly, and interested in the patients’ well-being.\n",

      "# PATIENT SATISFACTION\n",

      "Token Chunk 23: Patient satisfaction is the new buzzword. It’s the difference between providing what a patient needs and what a patient wants. It is important not only to satisfy clinical needs, but also to meet psychological expectations, which includes comfort and compassionate care. It is interesting to note that the two preceding sentences appeared in the last edition of this book written 12 years ago and they are still current. The fact that patient satisfaction is still regarded as a “new” trend demonstrates that it is still a work in progress and has not achieved enough critical mass to settle in as one of the basic components of patient care. Yet far more research has been done in the past five years to more closely define patient and customer satisfaction. The Picker Institute (www.picker.org) and the Center for Health Design (www.healthdesign.org) jointly sponsored research that culminated in a document published December 1997, Consumer Perceptions of the Healthcare Environment: An Investigation to Determine What Matters, a copy of which can be obtained from either organization. An effective video is also available. The Center for Health Design has also worked closely with JCAHO (Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations) to develop standards.\n",
      "--- ---\n",
      "Principal components of patient satisfaction are a warm and caring staff, comfortable surroundings, and the ability of patients and visitors to easily find their way around the medical center without getting lost. Convenience and ease of access are critically important as is privacy. Why privacy has only this past year hit the radar screens of regulatory agencies that create standards and inspect healthcare facilities is not entirely clear as it has always been important to patients. Of course, the federal HIPAA (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996) legislation kicked it into high gear. It’s a fact that change occurs at glacial speed in the healthcare industry, which is both good and bad. It’s good when evaluating clinical procedures or pharmaceutical agents that may threaten a patient’s life, but it’s bad when something as simple as providing privacy for someone who is registering for surgery requires, literally, an act of Congress.\n",

The powerful explosion of self-care Web sites on the Internet, coupled with unprecedented access to health data and medical research from one’s home “24/7” has dramatically changed the patient/physician interface.\n",
      "\n",
      "Shopping for healthcare services began in the 1980s. Prior to this, people visited the family doctor with whom they had grown up, or they selected a practitioner in the neighborhood. However, with the mobility that characterizes our society, people move frequently, and long-term relationships with healthcare providers are often not possible. Managed care has also impacted the “sacred” physician/patient relationship: physicians may be denied access to the care they think is best for an individual patient and patients may be forced to change physicians when they change employment or when health maintenance organization (HMO) physician panels change. Interest in holistic medicine and the proliferation of public information regarding the prevention of disease have also fueled the consumer-driven market.\n",
      "\n",
      "Token Chunk 26: One would expect a consumer-driven market to spawn competition among healthcare providers who, in the context of this book, are physicians and dentists, not hospitals. Dentists have historically been savvy about marketing and sensitive to consumer issues and there was a time when physicians had more impetus to attend to such concerns. Today, however, reimbursement for medical care has been impacted so dramatically by managed care and HCFA (Health Care Financing Administration) that just keeping the door open and the lights on can be a challenge. And, to be sure, there are large groups of patients who do not have the luxury of “shopping” for healthcare services: they may be uninsured and happy to receive any care at all. That’s the reality. Despite this, the issues raised in this chapter are important and should be considered when remodeling or planning new offices.\n",

      "# FIRST IMPRESSIONS COUNT\n",
      "\n",
      "Once the patient walks into the office, the waiting room should establish immediate rapport and put the patient at ease. First impressions are very important. Out-of-date furniture, worn upholstery, and grimy spots on walls may give the patient a message that the doctor does not care about patient comfort, or that he or she is reluctant to replace things when they wear out. No doubt, it’s more a matter of heavy workloads and the fact that physicians rarely walk through their own waiting rooms. But perception is reality. It may subliminally suggest that the doctor is outdated on medical matters as well, which can lead to a lack of confidence and breed anxiety in the patient.\n",
      "\n",
      "Token Chunk 27: Subliminal Cues. There is no substitute for live green plants in a waiting room. Plastic plants suggest that live plants probably could not survive the environment, and the patient may fare no better. Healthy, lustrous greenery, on the other hand, promotes feelings of well-being. A poorly illuminated waiting room not only makes it difficult to read, but subliminally suggests to patients that the staff is trying to hide something — perhaps poor housekeeping. It is surprising how often one finds badly soiled carpet and upholstery. Professional cleaning of these items should be routinely scheduled. Burned-out light bulbs are the ultimate insult, indicating a consummate inattention to detail. A closed, sliding glass window with a buzzer for service tells patients that they are not really welcome — that they are intruding on the staff’s privacy. The receptionist should always be in view of patients and accessible to them.\n",

Burned-out light bulbs, waxy and dusty plastic plants, and the crooked magazine rack become exaggerated irritants.\n",
      "\n",
      "Token Chunk 28: Many people visit a physician or dentist during their work day. Excessive waiting leads to anxiety and hostility, with worries about time away from the office and being late for meetings. An emergency at the hospital or the delivery of a baby are situations that people will forgive. They understand medical emergencies. But physicians who make a continual practice of overbooking are, perhaps without realizing it, offending their patients.\n",

In the Arab world, olfaction, as expressed by breathing in the face of a friend, is considered a necessary part of social grace. To deny a friend of the smell of one’s breath is a cause of shame. Middle Easterners and Latinos will huddle together much more closely than will Americans in a crowd.\n",
      "\n",
      "Token Chunk 29: Thus, seating arrangements in a waiting room designed for Americans should not force strangers to sit together — this only intensifies the stress of visiting the physician or dentist. Yet, in deference to the ethnic diversity that characterizes the American population, flexibility should be built in to allow waiting in family groups as well as offer seating that minimizes interaction with strangers, since both options may alleviate stress for the widest number of individuals. Individual chairs should be provided and arranged so that strangers do not have to face one another with a distance of less than 8 feet between them. Chairs should be placed against walls or in configurations that offer a degree of security, so that seated persons do not feel they are in jeopardy of being approached from behind. Careful planning in this regard will assure patient comfort.\n",

Body positioned away from pe doctor is anoper. Stereotyped behavior (tapping toes, shaking a leg, or rocking) is anoper. At pese signs, pe doctor must reestablish contact wip pe patient to break pe “distance” barrier. Touching pe patient’s hand or arm and asking if he or she is okay is bop friendly and reassuring.

      "BUILDING SHELL DESIGN\n",
      "\n",
      "Efficient medical offices begin with an intelligently designed building shell. All too often, medical office buildings (MOBs) are planned by designers or architects who are unfamiliar with the special requirements of medical tenants; thus, the structure of the building does not lend itself to an efficient layout of suites. Structural column locations, stair placement, elevators, electrical room, mechanical shafts, public restrooms (if provided), and window modules either impede or facilitate layout of individual suites.\n",
      "\n",
      "Token Chunk 33: Other factors that influence the design of an MOB are the shape and size of the site, the specific requirements of a particular tenant or client, a beautiful view, or the architect’s desire to impose a unique design on the project. All of these factors have to be weighed and balanced along with applicable codes, zoning restrictions, and the client’s budget. A building that is completely functional and efficient, but totally insensitive to aesthetics may not rent as quickly as the owners may wish. But an MOB designed primarily for aesthetic merit, with only secondary concern for internal planning efficiency, will also be difficult to lease.\n",
      "\n",
      "Floor Area Efficiency\n",
      "\n",
      "To begin with, an MOB should contain at least 12,000 square feet of rentable space per floor in order to accommodate suites of varying sizes and configurations as well as to increase the efficiency of stairs and elevators. Larger buildings often have 20,000 square feet per floor. The elevator, mechanical equipment room, electrical room, and public restrooms can be placed in the core with rental space wrapped around the perimeter (  Medical buildings usually are designed to an 85 percent efficiency, but architectural features such as an atrium or a large lobby can reduce the efficiency to 80 percent.\n",
      "\n",
      "The core factor is 12 percent in  The building shell in  If the building is leased to smaller tenants, public corridors penetrating the 60-foot depth may have to be added, thereby reducing somewhat the potential rentable area.\n",
      "\n",
      "Special attention must be paid to locating stairwells when one tenant intends to lease an entire floor or half a floor. In such case, the public exit stairwell may fall within an individual suite — a nonpublic space. One way to handle this is to provide a third stair in the center of the building so that, even if one tenant takes half a floor, two stairs remain accessible for tenants on the other half of the floor (\n",
      "\n",
      "Token Chunk 34: One must remember, however, when locating a suite across the end of a building: If the occupancy load is high enough, two exits may be required, with a separation equal to one-half the distance of the diagonal of the suite. In a large suite, this would be achieved by extending another corridor perpendicular to the public corridor for the secondary exit.\n",

      "The structural support system for the building should allow as much flexibility as possible for the layout of tenant spaces. For a multistory building, a moment-resistant steel frame offers considerably more flexibility in space planning and window placement than does a building supported with “K” braces, for example. Of course, moment-resistant steel is a considerably more expensive option. Regardless of the type of system used, it is imperative that the structural engineer work very closely with the medical space planner, so that structural elements can be accommodated within the planning grid.\n",

      "Locations of structural columns should not adversely affect the flexibility of the space, if the building is engineered properly. Most rooms are small; thus, the density of partitions is high. Long spans are not necessary. A tradeoff inevitably arises here. Reducing the span between columns makes it possible to use lighter-weight beams, thereby reducing the cost of the building.

This is similar to the 28-foot bay depth in that it is also a double-loaded corridor, except that the row of rooms closest to the public corridor is 16 feet deep. This is where the waiting room and business office would generally be located. A 3000-square-foot suite, at a 32-foot bay depth, would be 92 feet long and would involve long walking distances. Therefore, a 3000-square-foot suite would be accommodated better in a 44-foot bay depth where a center core, or island, may be used. A 44-foot bay depth works well for suites between 1800 and 4000 square feet.  With suites less than 1800 square feet, a 44-foot-bay depth does not allow enough windows.

If suites are laid out with a storage room at the end of a corridor, as shown in the 798-square-foot suite in  Suites over 4000 square feet work well in a 60-foot bay depth. Starting at the public corridor wall and moving toward the exterior wall, this allows for a 16-foot-deep row of rooms, a 4-foot-wide corridor, two 12-foot-deep rows of rooms back to back, another 4-foot corridor, and a 12-foot-deep row of rooms parallel to the exterior wall.

Since the terms of financing often specify that the building must be 50 percent pre-leased before construction begins, it is often possible to know who the large tenants with special needs will be, and the building can be shaped with those requirements in mind.\n",

A 33-foot bay depth would have, starting at the exterior wall, a row of 12-foot-deep rooms, a corridor of 5 feet, and a 16-foot-wide row of rooms near the building’s public corridor. The only compromise occurs at the end of the building where, if one has continuous windows wrapping the building with mullions on a 3-foot grid, a corridor of 5 feet, rather than 6 feet, puts a partition in the center of a lite of glass. This irregularity occurs only on the ends of the building.\n",

      "Considering a 45-foot bay depth, starting at the exterior wall, one would have a 10-foot-wide row of rooms, 5-foot-wide corridor, another 5-foot-wide corridor, and a 15-foot-deep row of rooms along the public corridor.\n",

      "Window Placement\n",
      "\n",
      "In recent years, there has been a trend toward larger exam rooms as well as wider internal corridors. This is difficult to accomplish with a planning module of 4 feet, since three windows 4 feet wide would lead to a room 12 feet wide, whereas 9 or 10 feet would be the goal for the width of a “large” exam room. Some prefer an exam room 9 feet wide—12 feet long, yet others prefer more of a square room 10—10 feet or 9—10 feet in size. A wider exam room allows the door to open to shield the patient and still preserve the handicapped access setback on the pull side of the door. Internal corridors would be 5 feet, rather than 4 feet clear.\n",
      "\n",
      "Token Chunk 40: Although at first it seems an odd number, a planning module of 3 feet will work well, provided the shell architecture and facade also comply. Windows, and columns, have to tie to the 3-foot grid. This provides exam rooms that are 9 feet wide, center to center, or 8 feet 6 inches clear, and consultation rooms that are 12 feet wide on center.\n",
      "\n",
      "Window placement is a significant issue in a medical office building. With so many small rooms, it is important that windows fall in the right place and that structural columns occur on the coordinates of the planning module so that they can be buried in the walls. Windows with mullions at 4 feet on center function well when a 4-foot planning grid is utilized. This permits exam rooms to be 8 feet wide (7 feet 6 inches clear) and consultation rooms to be 12 feet wide (11 feet 6 inches clear) along the window wall. The 4-foot window module can be reduced to a 2-foot module to permit even greater flexibility, but this amounts to an increased construction cost. When windows are irregularly sized, or something other than the 4-foot module, partitions have to jog in order to meet a mullion.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is important that windows start at 42 inches off the floor so that cabinets can be put under them, and patient privacy in an exam room is not violated. Even in a waiting room or lobby, windows should not start at the floor because it limits the area of seating. The glazing color should be gray, not bronze, because the latter tends to make skin look jaundiced.\n",

A standard suspended acoustic ceiling works well, but ideally, for acoustical reasons, should be laid out individually in each room with interior partitions extending above the finished ceiling 6 to 9 inches.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sometimes, in an attempt to make an architectural statement, the exterior of the building will have a stair-step configuration. This can greatly reduce the efficiency of the suites unless careful consideration is given to the length of each staggered section to make sure that a row of rooms will fit within it. Niches in the exterior wall can be even more of a problem, resulting in very irregular room shapes.

At the lower end of the spectrum, tenants cannot build even a simple suite without adding $25 to $30 per foot, from their own pockets, to the allowance. At the upper end of the spectrum, tenants may be able to build a “plain vanilla” suite (one with minimum casework, building standard lighting, and painted walls) at the tenant improvement allowance, without adding money to it. Generally speaking, tenants don’t expect to be able to build a medical or dental suite within the tenant improvement allowance. Suites such as family practice, pediatrics, and dermatology, however, would be less expensive to build than an ophthalmology suite, for example, which has a great deal of electrical work. At the upper end in terms of construction cost would be radiology suites, oral surgery, ambulatory surgical centers, and many dental suites. All of these contain a great deal of plumbing, electrical, and special construction details that make them extremely expensive to construct. For this reason, physicians and dentists are highly desirable tenants. They invest so much in tenant improvements that they move infrequently. Commercial office tenants often move every few years, whereas it is not unusual for a physician to occupy a space for 10 to 15 years. An alternate method of dealing with tenant improvements is to present tenants with a work letter stipulating exactly how many of each item (i.e., lineal feet of casework, number of electrical outlets, number of doors, lineal feet of partitions) they will receive per. 1000 square feet of rentable space. These quantities are tied to the per-square-foot allowance. In theory, if the tenant did not exceed those quantities of each item, per 1000 square feet, the suite would be built with no out-of-pocket expenses.\n",

      "Token Chunk 44: # POLITICS\n",

      "When designing tenant suites, one becomes aware of a fundamental issue: conflicting goals of various parties regarding tenant privileges and limitations. Of particular concern are ownership of the building (whether the tenants may participate in ownership), tenant improvement allowances offered by the owners, whether tenants may have their own radiology equipment, and whether tenants will be permitted to engage their own contractors. In essence, owners generally want to give as little as possible but lease the building quickly and at high rents, and tenants want to move into custom suites, designed according to their every whim, without having to foot any out-of-pocket expenses. The tug-of-war usually continues until the tenant actually takes occupancy of the suite, and then, little by little, the issues seem to resolve themselves. However, the space planner is often caught in the middle. If retained by the owner of the building to do space planning for the tenants, the designer’s obligation is to protect the rights of the owner; when employed by an individual tenant, the designer is charged with negotiating with the building owner to secure the greatest number of goods for the tenant. When one is the space planner for the building and also engaged to provide custom interior design services for a tenant, one must wear two hats and represent both parties well.\n",

Targeting one or two key physician groups is the best way to kick off the leasing effort. Physicians are often reluctant to be the first to lease space in a new building. It takes a couple of leaders who are not afraid to risk being first in order to interest other physicians. The strategy involves determining who those key physicians are and going after them. Their interest in the project signals the seal of approval to others in the medical community. Strategy also comes into play when determining optimum locations for various suites within the building. Some of this is a factor of the building shell itself, as suites of a certain size might be better accommodated in one location than another. Apart from that consideration, however, high-volume suites are best located, if not on\n",

Specialties such as general practice or internal medicine, which use radiology and lab services a great deal, would wisely be located adjacent to those suites. Low-volume specialties such as plastic surgery, neurology, or cardiac surgery might be located on upper floors, perhaps in a corner suite.\n",
      "\n",
      "For corner suites, one would not locate a 1500-square-foot tenant in a choice corner. These suites should be saved to use as an inducement to woo a prime tenant. Remember, however, when a suite is located across the end of a building, if the suite is of sufficient size to require two exits, there will have to be a separation between them. This is sometimes difficult to achieve at the end of a building.\n",
      "\n",
      "Token Chunk 46: Another issue to think about when laying out suites on a floor and taking into account the tenant’s preference for location is that it is important to not leave any “holes” or unleasable size spaces between suites. In order to avoid this, tenants cannot always be located exactly where they would wish to be. This is where the space planner’s skill as a mediator comes into play.\n",
      "\n",
      "The first tenants to express interest in a new medical building are often radiology, clinical lab, and pharmacy, but they are often the last actually to confirm a lease since they depend on the other tenants for their livelihood. If the building is only 50 percent leased upon completion and these tenants have to move in, they will suffer. Furthermore, they will want to know, in advance of signing a lease, who the major tenants are, so that they can project whether the composition of the building will generate enough revenue for them. A fully equipped radiology suite represents an investment of several million dollars in equipment and construction costs. Such equipment is not easily relocated.

For those arriving for lab work only, or for those who know they need lab work after having visited the physician and who are now on their way out of the suite, the lab is conveniently located near the waiting room. The exit/check-out path of travel is more or less separate from the ingress, and patients can exit from both sides of the suite without passing through the waiting room.

By glancing at a panel or pressing a button, physicians and staff can silently be notified of messages and emergencies, let others in the office know where they are located, and tell nurses and technicians where they are needed. The sequence memory program advances automatically, telling the doctor which patient is next. Monitor panels at nurse stations indicate at a glance the status of exam rooms, while another panel at the reception desk notifies clinical staff when patients have arrived and which provider they’re scheduled to see. Expeditor Systems of Alpharetta, Georgia, is a leading vendor of these systems.\n",

It’s not that younger physicians find this situation less frustrating, but their expectations may be lower since they were familiar with the new environment in which healthcare is practiced prior to entering medical school. They knew what they were getting into and one might even say that anyone going into medicine now must have the heart of a missionary as one can no longer expect it will lead to a life of wealth and privilege.\n",

This sets the stage for looking at a new way of practicing medicine that uses physician extenders for more routine examinations as well as digital technology to free up more time for the physician to spend with the patients who require complex diagnostic assessments.\n",

Lining the perimeter of the room with 24- to 30-inch-deep plastic-laminate-clad countertops takes full advantage of every inch of space in a way that freestanding desks or workstations rarely do, especially in small rooms or irregularly shaped spaces. Having said that, it is easy to mindlessly draw countertops, turning the 90 degree corner, and continuing, placing a task chair every 5 feet, giving the client false confidence that an efficient work space has been carefully developed for each of these persons, without truly taking into consideration the tasks each performs and the way in which they interface with patients and coworkers. Staff move into the space and are shocked to learn that their equipment barely — or possibly doesn’t — fit. The paper feed on their large printer requires a 15-inch grommeted slot in the countertop, there is no space for the hospital printer, and the space between the countertop and the 42-inch-high transaction shelf where two manuals are kept for ready access is half an inch too short.

Even a brief encounter of several minutes face to face with the physician can enhance patient satisfaction if the patient feels he or she has the full attention of the physician and if rapport has been established.

These procedures can be messy and require an adequate area for cleanup and a good-sized nurse station, plus lab support facilities.\n",

      "A lab should have a double-compartment sink, a knee space area for a microscope, and a full-size refrigerator, if necessary (otherwise an undercounter one). It may also have a blood drawing station with a specialized blood draw chair ( It is advisable to shield the patient whose blood is being drawn from the sight of other patients, who often become faint upon observing the procedure.

Since such a wide variety of medical procedures are performed and there is such a wide range of patients, it would be impractical to store in each exam room all the supplies one might need. Therefore, the nurse prepares the exam room with any special supplies, injections, dressings, and instruments that she anticipates will be required. A good many of these items will be stored in the nurse station, and each nurse station might have its own autoclave for sterilization of instruments. In addition, the nurse might give allergy or other injections at the nurse station; blood might be drawn for tests to be done in the suite’s own lab or sent out for processing; patients are weighed at each visit; and many other routine tasks are carried out here.\n",

In OSHA interpretations letters, it is not clear where, in a medical or dental office, they might be required. However, a large primary-care office might have one; urgent-care clinics (for walk-in patients) and ophthalmologists often have one for patients. The device must meet American National Standards Institute (ANSI) Z358.1-1990, as does the Opti-Klens®Institute.\n",
      "3. In offices where staff are exposed to bloodborne pathogens, staff should remove their lab coats prior to leaving the suite. The idea is to not carry home organisms on one’s clothing. Although not required by OSHA in physicians’ or dentists’ offices, depending on the specialty, the practitioner may wish to provide a locker room and change area for staff. Disposable items with bodily fluids must be red-bagged and labeled “biohazardous waste” and collected by a service. A biohazardous storage room, usually near the staff entrance to the suite, will house the waste until it is picked up. It can also be stored in a soiled utility room.

It should be visible and placed at an arm’s reach and below eye level at the point of use. According to OSHA, the fixture should be below the eye level of 95 percent of adult female workers, which results in an optimal installation range of 56 to 52 inches at a standing workstation and 42 to 38 inches for a seated workstation.\n",

In the author’s experience, much of the time, either no regulation exists or, if it does, its effect on the built environment has been misunderstood. The problem is that individual OSHA inspectors may cite a facility for a perceived infraction that cannot be found in a literal reading of the OSHA text. In addition, each state has its own OSHA interpretations. Physicians’ office staffs are right to treat employee safety issues seriously and to want to address them to the letter of the law since the liability and risks are substantial for noncompliance. However, much of the compliance deals with staff training, keeping procedure manuals updated, and making certain the staff actively follow the procedures they have outlined to protect patients and employees. In that regard, an excellent resource for OSHA compliance training, consulting, and compliance products is HPTC in Plymouth, Michigan (www.hptcinc.com).\n",

More complicated procedures will be performed in a radiologist’s office. A large internal medicine practice might have a suite of radiographic rooms within its facility with a full-time radiologist on staff. But usually a patient who requires GI (gastrointestinal) studies, thyroid scans, computed tomography (CT) scans, radiation oncology therapy, or other specialized or complicated diagnostic imaging procedures will be referred to a local hospital on an outpatient basis or to a nearby radiology clinic.\n",

Usually, a 9-foot ceiling height is required. There should be a place inside or outside the room for a patient to dress (ideally a 3-4-foot alcove with a drapery or door for privacy), a control area for the technician, and a place to process the film. Although the equipment breaks down into components, it is advisable to provide a minimum 3-foot-wide door in this room for ease in moving the equipment. Although new imaging equipment is digital and filmless, many physicians have existing equipment that is not and it is unlikely most will trade it in as long as it’s still serviceable.

Frequently, the door to the room must also be lead-lined. Such a door is very heavy and must have a heavy-duty door closer. The control partition, if located within the room, must also be lead-lined. It is possible to buy prefabricated, lead-lined control partitions with glass viewing panels from X-ray supply houses.\n",

By efficiently coordinating their schedules, the group can function well in less space, without sacrificing income or service to patients.

Space for a “crash” cart with defibrillator and portable oxygen is required wherever stress testing is done. In addition, a treadmill room also requires an exam table where the patient can lie down during the recovery phase. Working to maximum exertion can cause dizziness or nausea. In positioning the treadmill, there needs to be a wall in front of the patient for a “perceived exertion” chart, and the exam table must be near the treadmill in case the patient feels light-headed or unstable. The physician and tech need ready access to the right side of the patient to quickly replace an electrode that might have fallen off if the patient starts to perspire profusely.

In fact, because many precancerous polyps occur in the upper colon where they cannot be seen in a flex sig procedure, many now view that procedure with skepticism as it may give a false sense of security.

When the second edition of this book was published in 1990, physicians wanted to do as many tests as possible in their offices to capture the additional revenue. Today, in many parts of the United States, reimbursement is so low that the more procedures one does, the more one loses. Medicare is the largest payer in the United States, and what it will or will not cover and the amount it pays influences other payers as well as the types of procedures physicians are willing to do in their offices. If it’s not reimbursed, the patient may be referred to the local hospital for the procedure.\n",

When conscious sedation is administered, monitoring equipment and a resuscitation cart are required. Urologists often use this type of sedation when performing cystoscopies, but many physicians are reluctant to assume the liability and risks of using conscious sedation in their offices unless they do many procedures that require it and have properly trained staff to monitor patients. As an option, a surgeon may contract with an anesthesia service to assist in a procedure. An anesthesiologist or nurse anesthetist with a portable anesthesia machine will come to the surgeon’s office as scheduled.\n",

      "Token Chunk 147: As a prelude, it should be noted that physicians setting up office-based surgery suites have historically had considerable flexibility in the layout of these facilities, generally trying to fit two pounds of program into a one-pound container. Operating room sizes, space around each recovery bed, and ancillary rooms (clean and soiled utilities, scrub area, staff and patient dressing areas) have been left largely to the discretion of the physician, sometimes resulting in “funky” layouts. It is common to find a “prep room” in which clean and soiled are accommodated side by side, rather than in separate rooms. Minimum-width corridors and clearances may also have been compromised. Unless physicians seek Medicare certification in order to be able to bill a fee for the use of the facility (in\n",

      "Office-based surgery suites often fall into a “gray area” in terms of codes. For example, the Uniform Building Code (UBC) classifies them as a “B” or office occupancy if fewer than five individuals are incapable of self-preservation, which limits the enterprise to two ORs and three recovery beds or one OR and four recovery beds. (NFPA 101 limits it to four persons or fewer.) The local department of public health will, in many jurisdictions, send an inspector to review life safety issues and this individual may demand accommodations that go beyond what is stipulated in the local building code and in NFPA 101 Life Safety Code.\n",

      "Token Chunk 149: An example might be that the surgery portion of the suite be separate from the physician’s office practice with a dedicated entry and reception office. This seems unwarranted in a one-physician practice in which the doctor can only be in one place or the other. However, from the standpoint of patient safety, in theory, nothing would preclude the physician from allowing an “outside” physician to see patients while he is performing surgery and the front office staff might be distracted when called upon to assist in an emergency to evacuate a patient.\n",

      "Some of the newly opened centers are affiliated with a hospital, but other clinics are operated by physicians or entrepreneurial for-profit corporations. The for-profits tend to operate their facilities with an eye on the bottom line — that healthcare can be packaged and delivered as a product and earn a profit at the same time. Viewing healthcare as a business, rather than as a community service, makes the for-profits particularly sensitive to marketing trends and customer satisfaction. This is good news for designers. A client who is aware of marketing opportunities understands that the design of the facility will attract patients and, in turn, will lead to many patient referrals. Women find these facilities comfortable and nonclinical, with carpeted floors, wallcoverings, and residential-style lighting and furniture. Clients who are attentive to these issues may actually reduce their marketing costs due to increased referrals by satisfied patients.\n",

That interval of time can be torturous, whereas, in a breast center, psychosocial support is immediately available through counselors and nurses. Further diagnostic tests can be conducted at the same site with care coordinated by a concerned and familiar team of individuals.

Couples deal with guilt, blame, worry, and hope, living by ovulation cycles, and the optimum day to “do it,” and what started out as pleasurable sex has become fraught with anxiety, akin to a project or a job. The pressure is tremendous. And women, at some point, feel that biological clock running out of time. Once one enters reproductive therapy, there are no guarantees or magic bullets. One enters the world of critical timetables, cycles, and many steps in a process that are dependent on each other. Failure at any stage may mean aborting the process and starting over. Consider the highs and lows of waiting for news about results of blood tests, sperm motility, viability of the eggs, and whether fertilization has taken place. Add to this the hormonal changes resulting from fertility drugs that can cause strong emotions and unpredictable outbursts. Trying to conceive is a stressful process and infertility treatment an ongoing enterprise. With all the magic associated with a successful outcome, the day-to-day reality of the ordeal can be physiologically and psychologically grueling. To help individuals and couples manage these emotions, counseling sessions teach coping skills, stress management, and relaxation techniques. The financial impact of infertility treatment is substantial. Individuals who have tried unsuccessfully for several years to conceive may have mortgaged their homes, borrowed from friends and family, sold their automobile, to be able to continue with the treatment.

      "---\n",
      "office component, which, in most codes, is a business occupancy (assuming this is not a hospital-based facility); the clinical laboratory; and the operating room suite. One should consult the state’s business and professions code, if such exists, as well as the state’s department of health services. There are nationally recognized accreditation agencies such as AAAHC and AAAASF (refer to the Plastic Surgery section and Chapter 7 for detailed discussion of these agencies) that will accredit these facilities, and there is JCAHO, but practitioners may also wish to consider state accreditation agencies for ambulatory care. As an example, in California, it’s the Institute for Medical Quality, a subsidiary of the California Medical Association. This agency is approved by the Medical Board of California to verify compliance with assembly bill AB-595, also known as the Spiers Bill. Similar bills may have been enacted in other states, but in California, as of 1996, any medical practice from solo to small group to multiservice ambulatory centers that administers general anesthesia must be either licensed by the Department of Health Services, obtain Medicare certification, or be accredited.\n",
      "\n",
      "Token Chunk 180: Clearly, licensing and Medicare certification are quite rigorous in terms of facility design, whereas many accreditation agencies focus more on policies and procedures such as infection control measures, patients’ rights, hospital transfer agreements, quality management/quality improvement, calibration logs of equipment, documentation of periodic safety drills, testing of back-up power, pharmaceutical control logs, and review of medical charts. Achieving Medicare certification will most likely mean that the surgery center portion of the suite — even if it’s just one procedure room with ancillary spaces — will be isolated from the medical office, having its own entry, business office, and waiting area. This is what is demanded for office-based surgery facilities. However, it is clearly a gray area for IVF suites because the nature of what is done in the procedure room is “procedures” rather than surgery.\n",
      "\n",
      "General Anesthesia Is the Trigger If general anesthesia is used, the facility will have to be licensed or accredited. The AIA Guidelines for Design and Construction of Hospital and Healthcare Facilities should be used as a guide, along with NFPA 101 Life Safety Code. Many physicians do not use general anesthesia for these procedures and, instead, use monitored anesthesia care (IV sedation with oxygen), which causes a twilight sleep and does not involve intubation. An anesthesiologist would participate during these procedures and resuscitation equipment should be available in the procedure room.\n",
      "\n",
      "Token Chunk 181: Clinical Lab Regulatory Issues Certification. Certification is both mandatory and voluntary for the clinical lab component of the suite, which involves blood draw, the andrology lab, and the IVF/embryology lab. Currently, three states — California, New York, and Florida — require clinics to be licensed as a tissue bank if human tissue is collected, processed, stored, or distributed for purposes of transplantation in either the andrology or the embryology lab. States also issue licenses for clinical laboratories and one would have to be certified by CLIA (Clinical Laboratory Improvement Act), a federal program regulated by the Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA). The reader is referred to a discussion of CLIA in Chapters 3 and 5.\n",

However, certification of these laboratories by states is voluntary.\n",

      "The collection room, sometimes referred to euphemistically as the donor room, is where sperm are collected. This room should be furnished like a comfortable lounge, with a TV and VCR. The pressure on a man to perform is enormous. A man may ejaculate through masturbation or with the help of a partner in the room. Although there are many steps involved, a simple explanation is that sperm are first separated from the seminal fluid through repeated washing and spinning in a centrifuge, later to be subjected to capacitation (alterations to the surface of the sperm head accomplished by incubating it in a specially prepared culture to increase its ability to penetrate the egg).\n",
      "\n",
      "Token Chunk 183: The initial visit starts with a comprehensive physical and gynecological exam, a review of family and social history, and a review of male-related infertility issues. This initial interview and examination may take 45 to 50 minutes. Because the reasons for infertility problems are so diverse, the number of procedures to address these problems are similarly diverse. To give some idea of what is involved, consider two of the most frequent procedures, egg retrieval and egg transfer. In addition to taking hormones, the woman will take a medication at home and within a specified period of time — generally 35 hours — must come to the office for the egg retrieval. This is an ultrasound-guided needle aspiration procedure that is typically done under conscious sedation. Patients are understandably very nervous prior to this procedure. Afterward, the patient is transferred on a gurney to the recovery room where she remains for approximately an hour. Eggs and embryos are kept inside an incubator while in the embryology lab except when they are removed to be inseminated, changed to a new culture medium, or prepared for transfer to the uterus. The embryo transfer is performed via ultrasound guidance to the uterus. It’s important that the woman be as relaxed as possible during embryo transfer as many stress-related hormones such as adrenalin can cause the uterus to contract. The nurse coordinator or counselor often sits at the bedside to coach the patient in relaxation techniques, often using guided imagery. Following the procedure, the patient is usually asked to lie on her back or side for one to two hours in the recovery area. This is a delicate procedure and it’s important that no bleeding occurs and that the embryos are not damaged.\n",

Air quality in laboratories is defined by Federal Standard 209E with classifications of Class 1, 10, 100, 1000, and so on. This Class number is the maximum allowable number of particles 0.5 micron and larger per cubic foot of air; the lower the number, the cleaner the air. International Standard ISO14644-1 classifications are rated as ISO Class 1, ISO Class 2, and so forth. According to both standards, Class 1 is the cleanest, ultra-pure air. ISO Class 2 correlates most closely to Federal Standard Class 100. The standard for an embryology lab is Class 100 air quality. The labs will have several laminar-flow hoods for carrying out certain procedures. The room should have a four-stage HEPA filtration system that purifies the air of the entire lab. The labs must have individual temperature, humidity, and velocity controls and there must be access to overhead ducts for periodic cleaning and changing of air filters.

      "Token Chunk 227: A plastic surgeon with a cosmetically oriented practice needs to “market” his or her skills and successes. Dentists specializing in cosmetic or aesthetic dentistry are in somewhat the same situation in terms of being interviewed by prospective patients and having to “sell the case.” Often, people self-refer, based on a successful outcome of a friend or relative, but the quest for an idealized self-image and the desire to restore one’s youthful appearance cause many women (83 percent of plastic surgery patients are women) to interview a number of plastic surgeons.\n",
      "\n",
      "As it is time consuming for the busy surgeon to do these initial evaluations, factors that increase the likelihood of that patient returning to have the procedure are worthwhile. This means that the appearance and function of the office are important. The prospective patient has to make a number of stops during that initial evaluation and the office should seem orderly and well organized. The patient may be greeted by the patient care coordinator who will discuss the type of procedure the patient has in mind and who may take the patient into a private office and allow her to peruse a book of “before and after” photos of patients who have had that procedure. The next stop might be the physician’s consultation room where the physician will interview the patient, perhaps sketch some possibilities, and show slides of patients who started out with a similar problem that has now been resolved. After the surgeon determines which procedures are necessary to accomplish the goal, the patient would move to the financial counseling office, or patient care coordinator, to discuss fees and payment plans and to answer any “process” questions. Ideally, the financial counseling office and consultation room would be near the front of the suite so that these patients do not have to mix with those who have already been scheduled for procedures and may be there for the pre-op workup or post-op visits.\n",

      "Token Chunk 228: Plastic surgeons often do surgery in their offices in a properly equipped office-based surgery center, described more completely later in this section. Those who don’t, will do their cases in an ambulatory surgery center, which may be available in the medical office building; or a free-standing surgery center where they have privileges; or a hospital, which is probably the least desirable alternative for plastic surgery unless it is so extensive that the patient has to stay overnight and receive an intensive level of monitoring. It should be mentioned that there are, in some cities, 72-hour-stay recovery-care centers which allow more complicated cases to be safely handled in an ambulatory surgical setting.\n",

Patients undergoing cosmetic procedures are often very concerned about bumping into friends and neighbors. It is not uncommon for people to visit a plastic surgeon in another city in order to safeguard their “secret.”\n",
      "\n",
      "There are other advantages to surgery outside the hospital setting. The surgeon has more control over scheduling when procedures are done in the office, and the patient avoids the generally frightening experience of being admitted to a hospital. It usually lowers the cost for the patient and permits the physician to charge a fee for the use of the operating room, rather than lose that fee to the hospital.\n",

      "Token Chunk 229: In some plastic surgery practices, approximately 95 percent of the surgery caseload can be performed in a properly equipped operating suite within the office. Liposuction has become one of the most commonly performed procedures for removing unwanted fat from the stomach, buttocks, thighs, or other areas. Briefly, in this procedure, an incision is made in the skin, a cannula (tube) is inserted, and the fat is suctioned out. Other procedures commonly performed by plastic surgeons include facelifts, breast augmentation (or reduction), rhinoplasty (reshaping the nose), hair transplants, hand surgery, skin grafts for burn survivors and repair of cleft palate (both usually done in a hospital setting), breast reconstruction associated with cancer surgery, and other disfiguring malformations of the face and head.

      "Token Chunk 231: The composition of the plastic surgeon’s practice will dictate the design features that need to be incorporated. A practice dedicated to cosmetic surgery may cater to an affluent clientele who expect a luxurious office. Of particular importance is a secluded entrance so that clients may park their cars and conveniently enter the office without being seen. After the procedure, they can slip out a private exit and elude others in the waiting room. For this reason, plastic surgeons who specialize in cosmetic surgery frequently prefer a ground floor location, with a private driveway or turnaround so that patients need not walk through the lobby or public areas of the medical building. This is valid even when the practice is composed of a less affluent population. Patients who elect to have cosmetic surgery may be self-conscious about it and prefer privacy. It is very important to understand the practice’s patient base and procedure mix. A common design mistake is to tailor it for the wrong target market. Today, plastic surgery has a wide middle-income base and, depending on the demographics, a high-profile design may be intimidating.\n",

      "\n",
      "Any discussion of office-based surgery begins with the issue of reimbursement. Unlike surgery performed by ophthalmologists, most plastic surgery is elective in nature and, as such, would not be covered by third-party payers. Therefore, designing the surgery suite to meet the criteria for reimbursement by third-party payers seems a moot point. Those cases that would be reimbursed (for example, reconstructive surgery to attach a severed finger or surgery to restore a burn victim’s appearance) would be done outside the office in an ambulatory surgical center or hospital.\n",

      "Major changes have recently occurred with respect to enhancing patient safety in the office-based surgery setting. While there are many differences among individual states, from the national perspective, the American Society of Plastic Surgeons and the American Society for Aesthetic Plastic Surgery mandated January 1, 2002 compliance for their members to operate in facilities that are accredited by one of the national accreditation organizations, or be Medicare certified (even a more rigorous standard), or be state licensed, also quite stringent.\n",
      "\n",
      "What triggers compliance with NFPA fire codes is whether more than four persons are incapable of self-preservation at one time. If not, meeting occupancy codes will generally suffice. As most plastic surgeons (according to AAAASF) have only one operating room, it is unlikely that four or more persons would be in that condition. But this is certainly a gray area and open to interpretation. Common sense dictates that even one patient deserves the maximum in safety and protection, especially if you are that one person. But this explains why, for many years, plastic surgeons in some states have been able to get occupancy permits for undersized surgery suites that fall short, according to many criteria, of what would be expected today.\n",
      "\n",
      "Token Chunk 235: For those to whom this may be new, states license hospitals and all types of hospital-based surgery facilities, imposing what are generally regarded as the highest or most rigorous standards in terms of patient safety, minimum sizes of rooms, and a host of other issues. Most\n",
      "---\n",
      "facilities that are state licensed will also have achieved Medicare certification. Medicare is a program under HCFA (Healthcare Financing Administration). Medicare uses NFPA 101 (Life Safety Code) and a local fire marshal — and sometimes an additional inspector who may be a retired surgeon — to inspect for compliance. With either licensing or Medicare certification, a fee for the use of the facility may be billed. Of the national accreditation associations, the AAAASF (American Association for Accreditation of Ambulatory Surgery Facilities), located in Mundelein, Illinois, considers itself to have the most rigorous standards with very tough quality assurance and, according to the director, is the only organization that requires semiannual peer review. The AAAASF accredits facilities for all surgical specialties as listed by the Board of Medical Specialties, including OB-GYN, urology, ophthalmology, ENT, plastic surgery, and orthopedics. It should be noted that AAAASF excludes dermatology because it is not listed as a surgical specialty. Nor will it accredit endoscopy facilities, but AAAHC (Accreditation Association for Ambulatory Healthcare) will.\n",
      "\n",
      "Token Chunk 236: It is not possible to print a definitive guide to negotiating the minefields of accreditation, certification, or licensing because one will encounter codes that are contradictory, gray areas that are ambiguous, and local inspectors whose personal experience leads them to make demands that are not stipulated in the code manuals, yet they are in a position to deny certification if their requests are not satisfied. All of this is nasty business for the designer or architect who wants to turn over a successful project and meet the client’s expectations. To add complexity to these matters, one agency might use a different version of the code than another. Medicare might require the 1985 NFPA and this is what AAAASF uses, as of this writing; however, the latter anticipates going to the 1997 version, according to a discussion (April 2001) with an official at that organization. In the 1985 edition, back-up emergency power might be battery operated or use a generator. However, the 1997 edition provides for a generator only with no grandfathering of what was formerly acceptable.\n",
      "\n",
      "The state of Nevada, on the other hand, requires, as of this writing, the 1999 NFPA code. In general, where there is a discrepancy, the more stringent code applies. Some states require a CON (Certificate of Need) for Medicare certification, whereas other states require state licensing as a precursor to Medicare certification, and some states don’t require either of these. In California, dermatologists must be accredited in order to do surgery. AAAASF does not preempt local or federal codes and the facility must always be in compliance with OSHA. AAAASF requests written documentation to prove that the physician has “like” privileges at a local hospital to do the kinds of procedures that will be performed in the office-based setting.\n",
      "\n",
      "Token Chunk 237: As a general statement, according to the executive director, AAAASF prefers not to give minimum sizes of rooms or be draconian in terms of facility design, but rather to be flexible in order to allow the physician to meet the objective of safety in a variety of ways. This is what it means by “adequate” when it states that “a separate and adequate recovery room must be maintained free and clear of litter.” AAAASF specifies that there must be 4 feet of open space around all sides of the OR table for patient safety during resuscitation. This is stated as, “needs sufficient space around OR table for emergency personnel to get access to the patient.” Separate clean and soiled rooms are required, without giving sizes. Instead, it might read, “instrument prep and assembly area must be separated by a wall from the space where instrument cleaning is done or, if not, a policy to disinfect the area each time must be in place.” Corridor widths are required to be “adequate” for movement of gurneys.\n",

      "Falling in Love with a Space That’s Too Small One may note considerable variation in these space plans with respect to the composition of the operating room suite. Typically, a plastic surgeon finds an “ideal” lease space in terms of location, views, the “right” building, and it invariably has less space than required to design an optimum operating room suite. If the surgeon does not intend to seek accreditation to be able to bill a facility use fee, and does not intend to allow other “outside” surgeons to use the facility, there is considerable leeway in terms of minimum sizes of rooms, minimum sizes of recovery bays, separation of clean and soiled, and numerous other factors that are highly controlled in state-licensed facilities and those accredited by Medicare. Refer to Chapters 7 and 15 for more specific information on codes.\n",
      "\n",
      "Token Chunk 241: Occasionally, a surgeon may request a large OR with two tables and only a cubicle drape separating them, but regulatory agencies do not allow this due to risk of cross-contamination and also lack of privacy. In a busy practice, while the nurse is prepping one patient, the surgeon may be completing surgery on another, and a nurse may be applying a dressing on the third before moving the patient to a nearby recovery room. On this basis, three operating tables could be in use simultaneously, sometimes even with just one plastic surgeon working, but it would be very expensive, in terms of space, to build three ORs in a one-physician practice. Some plastic surgeons design a large operating room that is divided into two separate rooms by a wide cabinet that can be accessed from either side but this is no longer allowed.\n",

Similarly, draperies, because they collect dust, are to be avoided in favor of PVC vertical blinds. All materials in this suite must be easy to dust or sanitize, and they must be as hypoallergenic as possible. Avoid dust shelves — any nonfunctional surface that might collect dust.

      "There are certain building materials that are known to off-gas VOCs, the most formidable of which is formaldehyde for many individuals. Particle board, often used as the substrate for plastic laminate in cabinets and casework, is made with formaldehyde. At considerable additional expense, one may buy domestic particle board — made without formaldehyde — but if it is stored even for a period of days in a millwork shop alongside conventional particle board, it will quickly pick up the odor like a sponge. An alternative to plastic laminate casework is solid hardwood cabinets with solid surface tops such as Corian. Moreover, the contact cements used with plastic laminates are high in VOCs. The water-based equivalents tend not to be as effective and often will invalidate a warranty by the fabricator. The EPA (Environmental Protection Agency) publishes excellent literature listing the VOC content and period of years one can expect these potentially hazardous agents to off-gas. There are numerous excellent resources and books that have been written on the topics of “sick building syndrome” and “green design.”\n",

Even in a new building, there are a couple of things that can be controlled. Carpet should be unrolled and exposed to fresh air to off-gas for a week prior to installation. Vinyl wallcovering should be avoided in favor of low-VOC, or no VOC, paint, which is readily availableMarmoleum® from most manufacturers. Forbo is a linoleum sheet goods product containing only natural materials. It does not need waxing and may be a good choice for rooms that are not appropriate for carpet. Finally, if operable windows exist, the suite should be fully ventilated for at least one week after all finishes have been installed, prior to tenant occupancy.

Keeping the relative humidity below 50 percent (which may require dehumidification) minimizes these allergens and their irritating by-products, which flourish in moist environments. In addition, exceeding the standard number of room air changes in the HVAC system can keep the air cleaner, as can meticulous attention to changing air filters on a regular schedule.\n",

      "Neurologists diagnose diseases of the nervous system and brain. Their patients are always referred by other physicians. Patients may complain of headaches, epileptic seizures, damage suffered as a result of a stroke, or perhaps a cerebral palsy condition that has resulted in facial distortion — a distended jaw or a drooping mouth. Neurologists manage progressively degenerative diseases such as Parkinson’s disease, Alzheimer’s disease, multiple sclerosis and Lou Gehrig’s disease (amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, ALS), which involves considerable “trial and error” manipulation of drugs. Responsibility for diagnosing tumors of the brain and spine falls to the neurologist, who also manages the patient’s care postsurgically, if indicated. This is a low-volume specialty, with the taking of a preliminary history and an interview in the physician’s consultation room or exam room requiring 20 to 45 minutes for new patients. Occasionally, there may be a small exam room opening off of the consultation room ( Two exam rooms per physician is generally adequate. A patient education room with TV and VCR and CRT with Internet access is useful for patients and their families to learn about neurodegenerative diseases. Planning for patients in wheelchairs is mandatory in this specialty. Individuals with spinal cord injuries may have large motorized wheelchairs possibly with attached portable ventilators. The waiting room and exam rooms must easily accommodate wheelchairs; a corridor width of 5 feet is optimal.\n",

This means the physician need not invest in the equipment or bear the cost of additional space to accommodate it. Moreover, the increased availability of MRI and CT (computer tomography) scans — the gold standard in neurological diagnosis — has greatly reduced the number of EEGs (electroencephalograms) performed although they are still used for epilepsy. It is necessary, nevertheless, for space planners to be familiar with this test and equipment. \n",

Fluoroscopy is used where the space is anatomically small and hitting the target may be difficult without the help of fluoroscopy.

      "Chronic and intractable pain is a huge problem in that it affects approximately 50 million Americans and results in considerable loss of productivity and time away from work. In the inpatient setting, only recently has pain been documented as one of the vital signs. Patients are asked to rate their level of pain, which is recorded in their chart, along with vital signs. For those with terminal illnesses, there’s currently much discussion about the appropriate use of morphine and other narcotics to end suffering. For others, chronic pain — defined as that which no longer serves a biologically useful function — is terribly debilitating and, according to researchers, can actually change the wiring in the brain, spinal cord, and nerve cells by triggering the release of proteins that cause tissue damage. Pain can actually become a disease in itself. Treating it is often a trial-and-error process in which sufferers consult numerous physicians and therapists trying to find the magical cure. Low-back pain is second only to the common cold as the most common cause of illness. Other common causes of pain are migraine headaches, fibromyalgia, arthritis, cancer pain, and that which results from traumatic injuries and degenerative disk disease.

      "Author’s Note: Writing this chapter has been a challenge in that digital imaging at this moment is a work in progress and, to describe it, is somewhat akin to shooting at a moving target. I gathered information from many sources to educate myself about the topic so that I could explain it to others. I contacted knowledgeable sources representing five perspectives: an architect friend and colleague whose expertise and passion about diagnostic imaging is well known; manufacturers, who understandably are proud of their new products and anxious to promote them; chief technicians with 20 to 30 years of experience installing a variety of imaging modalities and systems during their employment with major equipment manufacturers; regional vendors of X-ray equipment, accessories, and supplies; and radiologists. All of these resources have experience with film-based as well as digital imaging, realizing, however, that the latter is still in its infancy. What has been vexing is the difference of opinion on how quickly digital imaging will overtake the industry; the reliability of the interface — called DICOM compatibility — between equipment by different manufacturers; and what the final digital imaging system will look like 5 or 10 years from now when, one would assume, film has gone the way of the horse and buggy and a darkroom can only be found in the studio of a fine-art photographer.\n",
      "\n",
      "Token Chunk 291: My architect friend, who works for a national architectural firm and often plans diagnostic imaging departments for academic medical centers and 250,000-square-foot ambulatory-care centers, suggested that references to film and darkrooms should be cut to an absolute minimum, that in a very brief period one will not find even a view box illuminator in most settings. I got a different picture, however, from several radiologists I interviewed and from regional vendors of equipment and supplies. A number of the vendors said they are selling as much film now as they did five years ago and the conversion to digital will happen more slowly than some estimate because the financial analysis has to be favorable to enable radiologists to make the conversion, which, of course, involves many factors. If reimbursement for orthopedic films is low and since digital radiography equipment costs considerably more, the number of procedures one could feasibly do within the workday may provide a poor return on investment, although one also has to factor in the expectation that digital imaging enables higher throughput (patient volume) than a film-based machine.\n",
      "\n",
      "Token Chunk 292: Although most radiologists recognize the value of ultimately converting to a totally digital system, which will enable them to send and retrieve images over a network throughout the enterprise, they are dealing with the tremendous financial commitment as well as the risk of selecting the best manufacturers to partner with whose systems will ultimately prove to be the most reliable and the most flexible as the technology evolves. I also received a lot of practical tips and advice from the technical experts who are charged with installing the equipment and systems, keeping it maintained, and troubleshooting when there are problems. Oblivious to the marketing hype of “how DICOM compatible every item is,” they will tell you that a lot of black boxes (electronic pieces of equipment that create an interface between non-DICOM-compatible items), switches, patch panels, and converters are required to make it all work at the current time. Clearly, this industry is changing rapidly and the plethora of products introduced every couple of weeks to manage and store digital data is staggering. As in any field when rapid change takes place, eventually a number of leading products emerge, while others fall by the wayside.\n",
      "---\n",
      "I’ve presented in this chapter represents all the viewpoints I’ve heard from respected sources and I’ve tried to present an unbiased view of the industry today. However, I was limited as to the number of equipment photos I could use and I regret I could not include selections from all major manufacturers. I was pleasantly surprised to see, compared with 10 years ago when the second edition of this book was written, how dramatically product design has improved. Every manufacturer has CT, MR, and nuclear imaging equipment that is so sleek and sculptural — which is hard to imagine for items of such large mass and weight. Compared to equipment available 10 years ago, it seems as if design and aesthetics were not even factored into the equation at that time. # DIAGNOSTIC IMAGING\n",

      "Token Chunk 293: What’s new in diagnostic imaging? Everything. Nowhere in healthcare has the digital revolution had more impact. The goal is seamless transfer of images throughout the enterprise — total connectivity among physicians, radiologists, and hospitals. Referring physicians and specialists who previously had to wait many hours to several days for a film to be retrieved and delivered now have instant access to patient information. No misplaced or lost films; no need to carry films from one location to another; elimination of X-ray retakes (exposing the patient to more radiation) to compensate for errors in technique; and elimination of the cost of film. Of course, to accomplish this massive undertaking, eventually all diagnostic imaging equipment has to be digital so that images go directly to a network where they can be reviewed, analyzed, distributed, and, ultimately, stored. GE’s PathSpeed™ is an example of a PACS (Picture Archiving Communication System) that manages data. Many manufacturers are developing PACS, each offering certain commonalities as well as distinctive proprietary features to give them a marketing edge. Once one recovers from the trauma of conversion from film to digital, the day-to-day ease and speed of working with images on a monitor, and being able to send an image to a remote specialist for consultation (by a teleradiology connection), no doubt the expense and discomfort of learning and mastering a new system will be justified. Certainly, there are various steps that can be taken to ease into a fully digital work environment. The easiest conversions, of course, are CT and MRI because they are digital modalities to begin with. Ultrasound is also digital, which leaves — in the basic radiology suite — a general radiography room, a radiography and fluoroscopy (R/F) room, and mammography. As new equipment is purchased, these investments will most likely be digital and, over time, the entire enterprise will be a totally integrated digital environment.\n",

      "Token Chunk 294: The overarching goal in the transformation from analog/film images to digital is the hope of acquiring better diagnostic information in less time. Conventional X-ray film and chemicals are being replaced by silicon detectors and images that are displayed almost instantaneously on a high-resolution monitor. With such systems, a physician is able to send an image electronically to colleagues for discussion and evaluation in real time, all looking at the same image on their respective monitors. Currently, pulling a reference film from five years ago to compare it with a new one can be a challenge, requiring the time of a file clerk to find it and someone to transport it to the referring physician or radiologist, and then reversing the process to get it back to the hospital. Many steps, many people. Ideally, when hospital images are all digital and there is total interconnectivity within the enterprise, the images should be available within moments, rather than days or weeks. The overall goal is not just to move film.\n",

A recent trend in some regions of the nation is the freestanding radiology enterprise that contracts with physicians and hospitals. It frees hospitals from having to make an investment in expensive equipment, keep it maintained, and employ technical staff. Although it would seem cumbersome and costly to transport inpatients to an off-site facility, apparently this is occurring in some regions.

      "Ultrasound does not involve radiation. A high-frequency sound, much like sonar, bounces off internal body structures. Ultrasound is particularly useful in examining soft pelvic tissue masses, gallbladders, or a fetus in the womb — procedures where even low doses of radiation might be dangerous. Ultrasound is also commonly used to image the heart (echocardiography) and for studies of blood flow in arteries and blood vessels. It is commonly used to analyze suspicious breast lesions, and tissue can also be biopsied using ultrasound. Physicians who do in vitro fertilization use ultrasound routinely during a variety of procedures.\n",

      "Token Chunk 303: Nuclear medicine deals with the diagnosis and treatment of disease with radioactive isotopes — chemicals that are unstable and break down, giving off radioactivity. The isotope may be given to the patient orally or by intravenous injection. The substance is specific to a particular gland or organ (e.g., iodine travels to the thyroid gland). The amount of the isotope absorbed by the gland permits the radiologist to determine the function of the organ and to trace its outline. Nuclear scans are useful for diagnosing brain tumors and malfunctioning of the kidneys, pancreas, and thyroid. Positron emission tomography (PET) scanners are considered one of the best modalities for detecting cancer lesions. One of the most stunning advances in technology is the CT/PET combination, which allows a fusion of CT’s rendering of anatomy with PET’s imaging of critical metabolic processes.\n",

Thus, CT scans have eliminated much exploratory surgery and offer the patient greater safety by reducing the need for more dangerous, often painful, tests.\n",

      "Token Chunk 304: The patient lies on a table that slides through a rotating doughnut-like enclosure called the gantry. X-rays scan narrow cross sections of the body in a painless, noninvasive procedure. For example, 180 scans just 1 degree apart may be taken of an area. The numerous images are collected by a detector and reconstructed by a computer into a composite scan of the organ or tissue. CT scanners represented a major breakthrough in diagnostic imaging technology when they were introduced in 1977. The newest CT scanners are multislice, six times faster than traditional single-slice scanners. During the scan, three-dimensional (3-D) images are built in real time and are completely constructed by the time the scan ends. Potential future uses include measurement of cerebral blood volume and flow, used in evaluation of stroke.\n",

The American Cancer Society claims that 1 out of 10 women in the United States will get breast cancer at some point in her life. Therefore, screening mammographies are recommended on a regular basis for women over the age of 40 and perhaps even earlier for those who have a family history of breast cancer. As of this writing, mammography is more commonly film based, although the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recently approved a full-field digital mammography system.\n",

      "Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has been heralded as a major innovation in diagnostic imaging and, today, it represents 20 percent of the medical imaging market, according to Medical Imaging magazine. It provides exceptional soft-tissue contrast and is especially good for imaging the central nervous system and, in particular, the brain. It permits early and accurate diagnosis of a wide variety of conditions, including brain tumors, strokes, hemorrhage, and multiple sclerosis. Spinal cord compression is more effectively shown by MRI than by other imaging techniques. A pinched nerve or the effects of arthritis can be graphically demonstrated and may prevent the need for a myelogram or CT study. MRI is also effective for diagnosing knee injuries and cancers of the musculoskeletal system. MRI does not use X-rays, but rather depends on the interaction of radio waves and small particles within the body, called protons, in the presence of a strong magnet.\n",
      "---\n",
      "ic field generated by the MRI equipment. A simplified explanation of a very complex process follows. Inside the body, protons absorb energy from incoming radio waves of various frequencies and, in turn, give off energy in the form of radio waves. These outgoing signals are recorded by a highly sophisticated computer and reconstructed into an image similar to that produced by CT, but generally with higher resolution, showing more detail and an enhanced view of diseased tissues. Advantages to the patient are that no special preparations are required before the procedure, no injections of contrast media are generally required, and it does not use radiation. Although currently MRI examinations are expensive and take longer than a similar CT procedure, this may change as the technology advances. Other applications of MRI include in vivo spectroscopy and study of living tissues, providing information on processes occurring inside the cell. A single example of the derived benefit of this is diagnosing a tumor without resorting to biopsy, based on the fact that tumors are known to affect cell metabolism. There are many applications of MRI continually in development.\n",

      "Planning Considerations\n",
      "\n",
      "Token Chunk 306: The purpose of this chapter is to introduce the reader to the most common diagnostic imaging modalities and to explain the general parameters of designing rooms to accommodate this equipment. Clearly, one could write an entire chapter on each of the modalities if one wanted to cover thoroughly all aspects of design and construction. The focus of this discussion is the outpatient radiology facility that would commonly be found in a medical office building, as opposed to one located within a hospital. Before a space planner can begin to lay out the suite, a program must be developed. There is a difference in how this is accomplished when the client is an independent radiology group developing a tenant space in an MOB versus a client that represents a radiology department that will serve a 250,000-square-foot ambulatory care center affiliated with a hospital. In the former case, the radiology group will generally detail for the space planner the number and type of diagnostic imaging rooms that will comprise the suite. There is no way a space planner can second-guess this, as it depends on a number of considerations. First, if the radiology group has CT at another office not too far away, it’s unlikely they will duplicate this equipment. Second, the number of physician tenants in the building and their respective specialties will influence the type of equipment the radiologists buy. Third, the medical building’s proximity to a hospital and the type of imaging modalities available at the hospital may influence the selection of equipment for the facility, especially if the same radiology group staffs the department at the hospital. In the other example (the radiology department serving a large ambulatory center), the programming will be done by the architect or planner who will do workload analysis to determine the number and type of procedure rooms required . This must be done in collaboration with the radiologists as throughput (volume on each imaging modality) will be influenced by decisions to purchase new equipment and the extent of overall digital integration in the enterprise. If the medical center with which the ambulatory facility is affiliated has a high-profile cardiology, oncology, or neurosciences center, a high enough volume of patients in one of these areas may warrant the purchase of specialized imaging equipment. All of these issues must be considered and factored into the workload analysis and ultimate program that is developed. These are the six basic planning considerations:\n",

      "A number of manufacturers offer equipment for each imaging modality. Room size and critical dimensions vary considerably, as do utility requirements. There are numerous accessory or ancillary items that may be added to each major piece of equipment. The space planner, therefore, may be faced with a number of possible combinations of equipment for an individual room. The radiologist will make these selections, but the space planner must obtain from each manufacturer a planning guide and specifications for each unit. Clearly, equipment dictates the size of each room, with function and future requirements being the two important considerations. It should be noted that manufacturers usually offer planning services to lay out a department and often produce almost a full set of construction documents. One must remember, however, that their goal is to sell equipment and to make sure it fits in the room. These services should be relied on only to provide technical assistance to the space planner or architect, who is much more likely to produce a functional layout that considers overall patient flow, business office activities, and the relationship of each room to the whole. When equipment is placed in the room, function is achieved when proper clearances are preserved for items that swivel, extend, or tilt and for travel of the tabletop. Other aspects of function are patient access and staff ability to move around the room (e.g., if a patient needs to be transferred from a stretcher or gurney alongside the X-ray tabletop). Finally, each procedure room must have an area within it, or outside of it, for controls. Within the room, the control area is a lead-lined partition with a window in it. The tech stands behind it to operate the generator that controls the equipment in a film-based set-up. Note that the window must have a minimum 18 inches of wall on the leading or open end to protect the tech. The control unit is not very large as shown in \n",

The scan itself may take anywhere from 30 minutes to two hours, again depending on the part of the body being studied. Gamma cameras may have single, dual, or triple detectors.

The Gauss field is measured from the center of the magnet in all directions. If the 5-gauss line extends outside the room, the area must be secured and a sign posted notifying passersby of the high magnetic field. If the area extends outdoors, it must be secured with a chainlink fence. When the magnet is up and running, the 5-gauss field must be measured and a report filled out and filed with regulators. Magnetic fields are three dimensional, extending outward on all sides, above and below, measured from the exact center of the magnet. Related to the magnet’s maximum operating field strength, the fringe magnetic field (the measurable stray field around the magnet) decreases in strength the farther one is from the center of the magnet.\n",

Even more sensitive are cathode ray tubes, image intensifiers, or other types of electronic equipment commonly found in diagnostic imaging systems. These must be kept out of the 1-gauss line. (As a point of information, gauss and tesla are units of measurement of magnetic field strength. 1 tesla = 10 kilogauss.) An assessment of all adjacent areas within the influence of the magnet is required to carefully identify the presence of equipment, people, or materials that may be sensitive to the magnetic field.\n",

      "The presence of ferrous material within the vicinity of the magnet can adversely affect the equipment’s performance. Ferromagnetic material may be either stationary or moving. Moving objects may include an elevator in the vicinity of the magnet, a passing automobile, or a piece of garden maintenance equipment. Structural steel beams and reinforced concrete in floors, ceilings, or walls are examples of stationary materials that may interfere with a distortion-free image. The negative effects of stationary material can sometimes be minimized by positioning the magnet symmetrically between and/or parallel to the ferromagnetic objects. Shims (energized coils that provide a magnetic field opposite to the one causing the disturbance) are another method of compensating for stationary ferrous objects. The most critical area is the floor immediately under the magnet. Each manufacturer has a specification on the allowable number of pounds of steel in a 10-foot-square area under the magnet. The next area of concern is immediately above the magnet, namely, the direction of the I-beams running overhead. If diagonal, it constitutes a problem. The magnet should be parallel and perpendicular to the steel in order not to disturb the magnetic field. High-tension power lines can also affect the magnet. However, one can evaluate the site with a Gauss meter to read the magnetic fields in the vicinity to see how best to site the unit. All metals have a maximum saturation, which means there is a limit as to how magnetized they can become. Stainless steel, for example, is at the low end with little potential to affect a magnet. An elevator in a corridor outside the MRI unit constitutes a large magnetic field that can interfere with the magnet, especially since it is a moving object.\n",

This piece of equipment cannot be broken down into smaller components. One might wonder how it arrives at the room. It is often brought through the roof or the side of the building. An MRI site should be planned at the time the medical office building is designed so that issues of access can be considered. It’s important not just to get it into the room initially, but to think about how one would remove it through a roof hatch or an access panel in the exterior wall. If traveling down a corridor, the load is spread on 2-12-16-foot-long planks of wood.\n",

It should be noted that although they do not show in the manufacturers’ marketing photos, there is a cryogen replenishment “chimney” or turret at the top of the magnet and some cabling. In some models, the cryogen tube folds and is recessed into the machine housing. There is also an electronic box for the gradient and shim coils on the side.\n",

A superconducting magnet of 1.5 tesla has a larger field of influence than a less powerful one. Minimum safety distances for objects in the magnetic fringe field must be carefully assessed. Inside the facility, a strict protocol regarding patient screening, the use of metal detectors, and architectural barriers can be used to protect visitors, as well as protect the magnet. A ferrous object in a person’s pocket can become a lethal projectile if too close to the magnet. For this reason, it’s important to provide lockers for patients’ valuables, as all jewelry, wristwatches, wallets, and so forth must be stowed.\n",

One is shielding to contain the magnetic field (however, machines are currently internally shielded); the other is shielding from radiofrequency interference (RFI). Noise generated by stray radiofrequencies distorts the image. Any penetrations in the room, such as doors, windows, light fixtures, or mechanical ductwork, must be filtered to prevent radiofrequency interference. Some brands of equipment are internally shielded from RFI, thereby eliminating the cost of shielding the room. There are many variables here; sometimes just half the room requires RFI shielding.\n",

Large ambulatory-care networks, such as the Mayo or Cleveland Clinic or the 100,000- to 150,000-square-foot hospital-based ambulatory facilities that have become so common in the past 10 years on medical center campuses, are far too complex to cover in one chapter. These facilities grow out of a context of politics (relationships between physicians and hospitals as to what departments will be included and how the revenue is to be divided); an analysis of market share; and a sophisticated master planning process that involves workload analysis using computer programs to model various scenarios, analyze revenue stream, allocate space by department, and estimate construction cost. Nevertheless, this book will be helpful at the micro level, as each department is planned, since the basic composition of each specialty suite and the layout of typical rooms, as well as the equipment used, will be relevant. In addition, the many patient-centered features and design ideas will be useful. The reader is reminded to read Chapters 3 and 4 as background for Chapter 6.

The Mayo Clinic is reputed to be the world’s largest medical clinic. While few aspire to this level of achievement, many of the principles upon which the Mayo Clinic was founded apply to smaller group practices as well. These include the sharing or pooling of knowledge, a division of labor that allows physicians to concentrate on their specialty, and a desire to stay on the cutting edge of new technology. It is a teamwork approach to the delivery of medicine.\n",

      "Token Chunk 370: There is an ever-increasing trend toward group practice. Economics and the threat of for-profit chains dominating the market have encouraged many solo practitioners to band together. Moreover, group practice offers physicians better managed-care contract negotiation power. Although some physicians do not feel psychologically geared to practice in a large organization, and some fear a loss of individual authority in medical matters, group practice does increase a physician’s productivity and may lower the cost of healthcare.\n",

      "In theory, each physician can be made more productive by eliminating the waste and inefficiencies inherent in a solo practice. A solo practitioner may work a 60- or 70-hour week, but perhaps 20 percent of his or her time is spent on office management. A group practice provides a division of labor with sufficient personnel to perform these nonmedical tasks, thereby enabling physicians to concentrate solely on practicing medicine.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another advantage of group practice is the convenience of having a fully staffed radiology department and clinical lab in the physician’s own office. Equipment that might be too costly or underutilized in the small medical office can easily be justified in a large group practice. Other benefits of a group practice are greater freedom with regard to leisure time. Partners can cover for one another with no lack of continuity in care for the patient. And physicians in a multispecialty group provide one another with immediate access to specialists in other fields. This pooling of resources provides patients more efficient and complete professional services than each physician could provide individually.\n",

The group-practice model that once sheltered physicians from some of the minutiae of private practice has imposed its own sort of tyranny, which, as reimbursement steadily decreases, enslaves them to “beat the clock,” seeing ever greater numbers of patients and enjoying it less. In past years, the billing of ancillary services helped to compensate for declining professional fees as managed care continued to dominate the marketplace. However, CLIA regulations and the Stark statute (relates to physician self-referral regulations) have made it difficult to vertically integrate ancillary services to enhance physicians’ income without tripping over conflict-of-interest issues and ever more complex compliance requirements.\n",

      "\n",
      "Token Chunk 376: In theory, any of these groups can be organized as a health maintenance organization although, since the obligation of an HMO is to provide a full range of health services to its members, it would most likely be only the large multispecialty group that would be prepared to do this. Kaiser is the best-known HMO of this type, referred to as a staff model because its providers are employees of the HMO. More commonly, HMOs contract with medical group practices, individual physicians, and other healthcare providers to provide services for their members who prepay a monthly fee, in addition to a fee or co-pay at the time the service is rendered. For many individuals, this arrangement centralizes and simplifies their healthcare and eliminates debates with insurance companies over what is covered and not covered, and it eliminates having to pay bills and write checks to a number of physicians. Members are issued an embossed identification card that is presented to the receptionist upon checking into the clinic. This saves time in heading up a form for each patient visit, and the identification card has the patient’s billing code and other pertinent information on it. Increasingly, these transactions, patient identification, and records will be digital. Thus, although an HMO may have more subscribers than a similar-sized multispecialty group that charges a fee for service, billing procedures are often less complicated (there are no insurance claims to file) and are facilitated by sophisticated electronic data-processing and computer systems.\n",
      "\n",
      "Token Chunk 377: Large multispecialty group HMOs like Kaiser have historically stressed health maintenance on the basis that it is less costly to keep people healthy than to treat them when they are sick. An HMO that follows this principle should be designed to accommodate many more patients than would a multispecialty group of the same number of physicians, and many more physician extenders will be employed in an HMO to provide health screening and other procedures aimed at preventive medicine. Having said that, it should be noted that the HMO of today differs from the somewhat idealistic model of yesteryear — one that promised to keep people healthy. Spending money to keep enrollees healthy only pays off if members stay with the plan a number of years. If they switch plans, the new HMO realizes the benefit. This has forced many HMOs to make tough decisions about how much they can offer at a capitated rate. Responding to inadequate government reimbursement, many HMOs pulled out of the Medicare program in January of 2001, dropping over a million elderly and disabled individuals. The number of HMOs showing profitability dropped from 83 percent in 1993 to 41 percent in 2000*.\n",

      "Ambulatory surgery refers to scheduled surgical procedures provided to patients who do not require overnight hospitalization. Ambulatory surgery may be provided in a physician’s office — in which case it is called office-based surgery — or in a freestanding, independent facility specifically organized to provide scheduled ambulatory surgery. In this chapter, the acronyms FOSC (freestanding outpatient surgery center) and ASC (ambulatory surgical center) are used interchangeably.\n",
      "\n",
      "Token Chunk 389: The practice of ambulatory surgery is not a new concept. The British Medical Association in 1909 reported 7320 operations performed by a Scottish physician on ambulatory patients at the Royal Glasgow Hospital for Children.* The results were reported to be as successful as those for inpatient surgery. However, the interest in ambulatory surgery declined somewhat until the early 1960s when the development of new fast-acting anesthetics made ambulatory surgery more practical.\n",

Some ambulatory surgical centers are entrepreneurial enterprises owned and operated by a group of anesthesiologists or surgeons and have no affiliation with a hospital. These facilities are commonly located within a medical office building, or they may be physically freestanding in a single-tenant building. It is this last example that is the focus of this chapter — a facility not owned by a hospital and located in a medical office building, or freestanding.\n",

      "Token Chunk 390: # ADVANTAGES OF AMBULATORY SURGERY\n",
      "\n",
      "There are many advantages to ambulatory surgery from both the patients’ and the physicians’ viewpoints. Some of these advantages follow.\n",
      "\n",
      "- Hospitals are geared to traditional inpatient surgery protocols, which are often inappropriate for ambulatory patients, whereas a facility organized for the sole purpose of ambulatory surgery would have a staff trained to meet the specific needs of these patients. Hospitals sometimes find it difficult to merge new protocols with existing systems.\n",
      "- Ambulatory surgery patients are not sick; they are candidates for elective procedures. In a hospital, their families may have to share a common surgery waiting room with\n",
      "---\n",
      "inpatients’ families, which can have a devastating psychological effect. Imagine the stress of sitting next to someone whose husband may be having open heart surgery.\n",
      "\n",
      "Patients often experience psychological stress when entering a hospital. Fear of the unknown is heightened by unexpected sights, such as a view of a patient arriving in an ambulance or seeing a patient on a gurney with an IV in the arm. Patients are generally less apprehensive when arriving for surgery in a facility located in a medical office building.\n",
      "\n",
      "Physicians and staff often experience greater satisfaction in an FOSC because they can tailor operational systems as they wish, with no bureaucratic red tape.\n",
      "\n",
      "There is much greater flexibility in scheduling procedures in an FOSC. In a hospital, ambulatory patients will be bumped to open up the schedule for urgent or emergent patients. Both physicians and patients find ease of scheduling an advantage in an FOSC.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ambulatory surgery provides better utilization of hospital beds and costs considerably less than doing the same procedure in a hospital. The major savings is due to the elimination of a hospital stay, and insurance payers often stipulate they will pay for certain procedures only if done within an ambulatory surgical center.\n",
      "\n",
      "Token Chunk 391: Ambulatory surgical patients receive less medication both pre- and postoperatively, and they often return to work sooner than people who have those same procedures as inpatients. Perhaps this is due to the fact that FOSCs promote a wellness philosophy, treating patients as if they are healthy, and allowing them to take responsibility for a large part of their own care.\n",
      "\n",
      "# OWNERSHIP AND AFFILIATION\n",
      "\n",
      "A great many mergers and acquisitions in 1999 resulted in 69.6 percent of FOSCs being independently-owned, 27 percent owned by multifacility chains, and 3.4 percent hospital owned. HealthSouth of Birmingham, Alabama, is the nation’s largest FOSC multifacility chain, owning 8 percent of the total market with 229 facilities. Columbia/HCA Healthcare Corp. is the second largest chain with 123 facilities.* If the HCFA ambulatory payment classification (APC) system reimbursement rates are more favorable to hospital-based outpatient facilities, this may tip the scale in that direction.\n",
      "\n",
      "# ECONOMIC AND REGULATORY ISSUES\n",
      "\n",
      "Prior to designing an FOSC, it is necessary to understand the facility’s goals with respect to licensing, certificate-of-need (CON) requirements, accreditation, and reimbursement by Medicare/Medicaid and commercial insurance carriers. Ambulatory surgery centers (ASCs) are highly regulated at the federal, state, and peer level. Most facilities will be state licensed, have Medicare certification, and JCAHO or AAAHC accreditation. AAAHC has been granted “deemed status” by HCFA (Health Care Financing Administration) to certify ASCs for Medicare participation as can JCAHO. The American Association of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgeons (Web site aaoms.org) offers a state-by-state summary of requirements for licensure and Medicare certification for operation of ambulatory surgical centers.\n",
      "\n",
      "# Licensure\n",
      "\n",
      "Token Chunk 392: # Licensure\n",
      "\n",
      "A facility owned and operated by a physician group practice generally need not be state licensed, provided that non-owner surgeons are not allowed privileges. However, the state business and professions Code in some states, such as California, does require even solo practitioners to obtain licensure, certification, or accreditation if they administer general anesthesia “in doses that place\n",
      "\n",
      "*SMG Marketing Group Inc. FOSCs Database, June 1999 edition.\n",
      "---\n",
      "patients at risk for loss of life-preserving protective reflexes.” In other states, a physician’s license to practice his or her specialty may meet the requirements. Surgical procedures are usually done on a small scale and are performed within the context of the physician’s practice. State agencies often do not regulate office-based surgery, although there is increasing pressure for greater regulation. The American Society for Aesthetic Plastic Surgery, for example, mandated that, by January 1, 2002, practitioners must be accredited by one of the national organizations such as AAAASF (American Association for Accreditation of Ambulatory Surgery Facilities), which accredits all surgical specialties. Office-based surgery facilities are discussed in greater detail in Chapter 4 under Plastic Surgery.\n",
      "\n",
      "When a facility is organized specifically for the purpose of ambulatory surgery, and a surgeon need not be an owner to be awarded privileges, then licensure of the facility is an issue. Licensing is often a requirement for receiving state reimbursement, and insurance payers may require that a facility be licensed for their participation. Furthermore, licensed facilities may be eligible for rate discounts from liability carriers.\n",
      "\n",
      "Token Chunk 393: NFPA 101 Life Safety Code and state building codes are the standard for all licensing and certification requirements. The designer must check with the state fire marshal, state facilities’ development agencies, the local building department, and the local department of health services to ensure that all requirements are identified. The cost of designing a facility initially to meet licensing requirements will be comparatively small compared with trying to retrofit it later to achieve compliance. Licensing offers a certain amount of economic security in that it assures the facility of receiving the maximum amount of reimbursement offered by payers. Currently, 41 states require state licensure of ASCs, making them the most highly regulated type of ambulatory medical facility.\n",
      "\n",
      "# CON/Health Systems Agency Review\n",
      "\n",
      "Each state is unique in its approach to regulating FOSCs. The Health Planning and Resources Development Act of 1974 mandated that state governments establish Certificate-of-Need (CON) programs to regulate healthcare facilities and services. In some states, a CON may be required for an FOSC, whether it be owned by a hospital or another entity. The purposes of the CON are to prevent duplication of highly specialized facilities and equipment and to keep a lid on rising healthcare costs. Some states exempt facilities from the CON process if they are not owned by a hospital.\n",
      "\n",
      "Token Chunk 394: In many states, the CON process starts with a review by the local health systems agency (HSA), which must endorse the project and make recommendations to the state. Early in the planning stages of an FOSC, it is essential to ascertain whether a CON may be required and whether HSA endorsement is mandatory. If a local HSA does not exist, there may be another areawide health planning agency that should be consulted. It should be noted that many states have abandoned their CON programs since the federal government ceased funding them. The national trend toward deregulation allows FOSCs a much easier path to their goals. Currently, 36 states have some type of CON regulations.\n",
      "\n",
      "# Accreditation\n",
      "\n",
      "The Joint Commission of Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations (JCAHO) can accredit freestanding ambulatory surgical centers that are not owned by hospitals; however, accreditation by the Accreditation Association for Ambulatory Health Care (AAAHC), established in 1979 (located in Wilmette, Illinois), is more common. This is a voluntary accreditation program aimed at quality assurance in all aspects of patient care. The agency publishes a handbook of standards for ambulatory healthcare as well as a code checklist for ambulatory surgical facilities based on compliance with NFPA 101 Life Safety Code. In summary, accreditation is a voluntary assessment process whereby industry experts and peers define conformity standards by which surveyors evaluate and rate the organization’s performance. It’s a means of identifying\n",

      "and validating for the consumer quality facilities that meet recognized standards.\n",
      "\n",
      "Token Chunk 395: It should be noted that there is a national nonprofit association for freestanding ambulatory surgical centers called FASA (Federated Ambulatory Surgery Association), with national headquarters located in Alexandria, Virginia. FASA publishes a bimonthly journal and an annual bibliography on ambulatory surgery issues with the goal of improving the delivery of outpatient surgery. FASA helped organize the AAAHC.\n",

      "Professional fees, and the other is the facility fee — the charge for the surgical suite, operating room staff, and supplies. Third-party payers vary in their reimbursement policies with respect to these two components.\n",
      "\n",
      "Physicians are generally reimbursed a “reasonable and customary” fee for their services regardless of whether the facility is licensed or certified; however, third-party payers will not pay for the use of the facility unless it meets certain criteria. These usually involve a strict adherence to the Life Safety Code. Therefore, Medicare certification and/or state licensure assure that the FOSC will be reimbursed for the use of the facility.\n",
      "\n",
      "Medicare certification is a requirement for receipt of federal reimbursement for patients eligible to receive these benefits. Medicare and Medicaid are programs administered by HCFA. With respect to the physical plant, Medicare does not stipulate sizes of rooms or number of scrub sinks per operating room, but rather relies entirely on compliance with NFPA 101 Life Safety Code. Medicare engages a local state fire marshal to conduct the survey of a new facility to verify compliance. Medicare certification paves the way for approval by other reimbursement agencies and insurance payers. It constitutes the seal of approval, so to speak. In reality, there is little difference between licensure and certification with respect to design criteria, because both rely on compliance with the Life Safety Code. Ninety percent of ASCs are Medicare certified.\n",

      "# MARKETING CONSIDERATIONS\n",
      "\n",
      "An appealing aspect of surgery in a freestanding facility is the element of choice. A physician may have privileges at several facilities and may offer the patient the opportunity to choose the preferred setting. Along with that choice comes the expectation of convenience and care delivered in a small-scale, noninstitutional, friendly environment. Patient satisfaction is necessary for a facility’s success, and many ASCs are keenly aware of guest relations. Both patients and physicians benefit from the fact that, according to a study by Arthur Andersen, more than 82 percent of cases start on time in ASCs.\n",
      "\n",
      "The interior environment is a critical element of patient satisfaction. The entire facility should use color to relax and soothe patients, and texture may be introduced in carpets and wallcoverings, whenever appropriate (in terms of maintenance and infection control). Artwork and accessories should not be overlooked as a means of distracting patients and making the facility less threatening.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, patients and their families are not the only ones who benefit from a well-designed environment. To attract top-quality physicians and nursing staff and to keep morale high, staff areas must be properly designed so that they are functional and they should look as attractive as patient areas.\n",

The National Electrical Code (NEC) is widely used across the nation to set standards for the use of electricity. This code, like the others described here, is implemented through adoption by state and local jurisdictions, and exact requirements vary somewhat from region to region. For instance, explosive anesthetic gases, which might be ignited by a stray spark, are no longer in use, yet some states require that conductive flooring and isolated electrical power be used. Other states recognize that this is unnecessary.\n",

Facility design, internal protocols for handling infectious waste, and proper protection during surgery are the three principal ways of reducing this hazard.\n",
      "\n",
      "Patient and staff circulation patterns bear significantly on the spread of infectious microorganisms. This often poses a challenge for the space planner, since program requirements often exceed available space, sometimes reducing circulation alternatives. State building codes usually establish standards for smooth and washable finishes and for special ventilation requirements within specific areas, but there is little of a definitive nature in the way of regulatory codes to assist the designer in laying out the suite to minimize the spread of infection. Common sense, experience, and guidance of the OR supervisor often dictate best practices.\n",

      "Token Chunk 402: Every aspect of patient handling is based on a protocol developed by the individual facility, to assure that nothing is forgotten or overlooked. While many of these protocols do not actually have an impact on the physical design of the facility, it is important for a successful project to include in the planning process representatives of all staff functions, including anesthesiologists, surgeons, nurses, and administrative staff. The space planner must avoid making any assumptions about a center’s operations that could inadvertently defeat operational effectiveness.\n",

      "There are seven stages of patient flow through the facility: preadmitting, arrival, patient prep, induction, recovery, postrecovery, and discharge. The patient’s first encounter with the facility may be a day or two prior to surgery, to complete preadmission forms, undergo laboratory tests, and receive dietary instructions. Sometimes this is handled by phone and lab tests are not always necessary.\n",
      "\n",
      "This may be the first time the patient has ever had surgery, or perhaps the first time the patient has had ambulatory surgery, and he or she may have no frame of reference upon which to rely to combat fear and anxiety. Therefore, it is important that the preadmitting process give the patient confidence about the experience. After all, a patient truly cannot evaluate the quality of the clinical care or the surgeon’s competence, but patients do make judgments nevertheless, based on interactions with staff and an assessment of the interior environment.\n",
      "\n",
      "A patient’s confidence can be bolstered by an understanding of exactly what to expect on the day of surgery. Nursing staff, anesthesiologists, and surgeons all play a significant role in educating and reassuring the patient. If the facility is designed well, circulation patterns will be predictable and convenient, allowing easy access for patients, staff, and family. Good design should make it easy for staff to do things right.\n",

The patient is next directed to a preparation area where street clothes are exchanged for surgical apparel. This may be handled in a number of ways. Some facilities have dressing rooms and lockers for storage of the patient’s belongings ( In the recovery room, belongings are returned to the patient prior to dressing for discharge. In many states, regulators insist that patient belongings be stowed in lockers.\n",

      "Some facilities do not have individual patient prep rooms and, instead, use a large room (called pre-op holding) similar to the recovery room, with gurneys separated by cubicle drapes for privacy ( In this situation, patients sometimes change clothes within this enclosure, or they may use a dressing/locker room. It should be noted that JCAHO and state surveyors are especially interested in visual and auditory privacy for patients in pre-op and postanesthesia recovery units (PACUs). New facilities should not consider cubicle drape separation as an option but should construct private bays for each patient to address these standards (\n",

      "After the patient is undressed, the operative site is scrubbed, shaved, and prepped for surgery.

      "Anesthetic induction almost always takes place in the operating room, although an intravenous fluid may be started in the preoperative holding area. Following surgery, the patient is transferred to the postanesthesia recovery area until he or she is conscious and stabilized. Many facilities use a second-stage recovery area that has recliner chairs and lounge seating ( Patients remain here after they are dressed, have some juice or tea, and leave when they feel well enough for discharge or when their escort has arrived.

The patient will be met by transportation at the facility’s entrance or pickup area, which is often a private driveway located near the surgical center’s discharge area. Optimally, patients and families should never have to backtrack through the facility.

With required support services, this translates to approximately 10,000 square feet. The sizes for Class A, B, and C ORs in the AIA Guidelines were stated previously. In other codes and standards, the minimum size of a minor OR is 270 net square feet, with a 15-foot minimum dimension across the room. The minimum size for a major OR is 350 net square feet, with an 18-foot minimum dimension across the room. It is prudent to size ORs larger than may have been anticipated in order to accommodate additional portable equipment such as microscopes for ophthalmic surgery, arthroscopes, lasers, video monitors, C-arm X-ray, and robotic devices that are becoming standard as ambulatory.\n",

      "Planning Issues. Operating room features that affect turnaround time between procedures deserve careful examination. The typical inpatient OR may be used for three or four procedures per day, each of which may last two to four hours, whereas an FOSC OR may be used six or seven times per day for procedures lasting 30 to 90 minutes.

The operating room is on its way to becoming an ultra-high-tech environment, integrating voice recognition systems, robotics, and PACS, and there will be more blurring of the line between interventional radiology and surgery as vascular radiology, neuroradiology, and cardiology become more invasive. CIMIT (the Center for Innovative Minimally Invasive Therapy, a partnership between the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Massachusetts General Hospital, and Brigham and Women’s in Boston) is currently designing a minimally invasive surgery suite using remotely controlled robots to execute the procedures laparoscopically. As an example, a coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), in the conventional procedure, involves opening the rib cage. But, when executed robotically, it can be performed endoscopically through a small opening and the patient can be playing golf just three days later, without the pain, loss of productivity, and rehabilitation required with the standard procedure. CIMIT is evaluating, among other things, whether the robotic control station for the surgeon should be in a remote location or within the room. In these high-tech ORs, the pieces of equipment will “talk” to each other. A nurse’s desk for computerized charting also needs to be accommodated.\n",

The Hackensack University Medical Center, at the end of 1998, opened a new ASC featuring 10 state-of-the-art laparoscopic surgery operating rooms. Each is equipped with video-laparoscopic surgery towers suspended from the ceiling by Berchtold Teletom® power booms, which neatly conceal electrical cables, gas lines, and video cables, removing the clutter of multiple cables and wiring as well as equipment, from the floor, mounting it on these articulating arms and shelves. In these ORs, various components of the electronic video equipment for laparoscopic operations are integrated through the use of a voice-activated robot called Hermes®. The surgeon wears a microphone and controls all of the equipment through various voice commands. The surgeon is assisted by a second voice-operated robot called Aesop®, which holds the video camera and points it in different directions. At Hackensack, patients are assigned a day accommodation room where they change gowns and are interviewed by the nurse and anesthesiologist prior to walking to the OR. After anesthesia recovery, patients return to this same dayroom to be rejoined by their family.\n",

      "Token Chunk 419: Simply stated, airflow in an OR should be from “clean” to “less clean” areas. Air should enter the room at the ceiling, above the patient, and be drawn off at two or more widely spaced locations near the floor. Filtration, number of air changes per hour, volume, humidity, and temperature are specifically mandated. In some circumstances, where the potential for infection is high, a laminar airflow system may be used. This system sends a large volume of slow-moving, nonturbulent, filtered air down over the patient and the operating team, preventing any particles from settling on the wound. An enhancement of this concept is the Steriflo® system by Krueger in Richardson, Texas. Forced sterile air, which is comfort conditioned to specific surgical requirements, creates a cube from ceiling to floor surrounding the patient and the surgical team. Contaminated air between the actual operating area and the four walls of the operating room impinges, but cannot penetrate, the curtain of sterile air and is immediately exhausted through the return air system. The curtain of sterile air is forced through pressure plenums and filtered downward through slot diffusers positioned in the ceiling around the operating table.\n",

According to FASA, the geographical distribution of surgery centers offering recovery care indicates a more favorable regulatory climate in the West. California leads the nation with 63 centers, followed by Texas and Colorado with 28 and 20 centers, respectively. There are currently 23 states that have 23-hour postsurgical recovery/surgery centers. Six states allow for greater than 24-hour stays in the surgery center setting, but they differ in exactly how they define and license recovery care. For example, in Arizona, the recovery-care concept grew out of a home recovery unit used by a surgery center. Eventually, the state passed legislation providing for a separate recovery-care license that enabled surgery centers to keep patients up to 72 hours. In Colorado, however, surgery centers may use a convalescence license that enables them to keep separate beds for patients who stay for indefinite periods.

      "OVERVIEW\n",
      "\n",
      "Sports medicine may be practiced from a sideline bench, a storefront therapist’s office, or a multimillion-dollar facility employing highly sophisticated techniques appropriate for highly paid professional athletes. Programs for these facilities vary widely depending on the location of the facility, the client or patient population it serves, the treatment philosophy of those who have set up the practice, and the medical background or skills of those individuals. In spite of these disparate considerations, many issues and concerns are germane to all sports medicine facilities, large or small.\n",
      "\n",
      "Token Chunk 436: Sports medicine is a practice that focuses on the physiological health of athletes — professional, amateur, and recreational — and the problems and injuries athletes encounter. The medical practice most closely allied with sports medicine is orthopedics, and the medical director of these facilities is often an orthopedic surgeon. Physical therapy and fitness training are the other two disciplines integrated into this practice. Sports medicine endeavors to achieve four goals:\n",
      "\n",
      "- Maintenance of health and physiological function\n",
      "- Improvement of performance\n",
      "- Prevention of injuries through training and education\n",
      "- Treatment and rehabilitation from injuries\n",
      "\n",
      "These goals are not unique to sports medicine, but the approach to achieving them may be. In the wake of ever-increasing investments in professional and collegiate sports and with technological advances in medical treatment capabilities, practitioners have developed techniques to allow athletes to recover from injuries more quickly and successfully. Treatment has gradually become more aggressive, and it is applied in a wholly integrated manner, taking into consideration the person’s entire range of activities in relation to his or her strengths and deficits in body structure, musculature, and overall fitness. The objective is to transfer the responsibility and motivation for success to the athlete rather than to allow the person to be a passive recipient of treatment.\n",
      "\n",
      "The success of these techniques has created public demand for access to testing, training, and treatment from sports medicine specialists. Practitioners have responded to this increasing demand by creating environments that offer services suited to the needs of a wide cross-section of the public. A sports medicine facility may combine any number of services, including physical therapy, nutritional counseling, deep-tissue massage therapy, biomechanical analysis, and even prosthetic or reconstructive orthopedic surgery.\n",

      "Marketing Plan\n",
      "\n",
      "Token Chunk 437: Marketing Plan\n",
      "\n",
      "A sports medicine facility’s marketing plan will have a direct effect on site selection and design. Location near a medical complex or hospital is very common for a source of patient referrals. Choice of facility, such as an existing space or a new building designed to suit, would be determined by the availability and flexibility of space and the complexity of the service program. Architectural detailing within the facility and interior design will be directly related to the desired public image.\n",
      "\n",
      "User Mix\n",

The traction to another, setting up a patient on a Cybex™ client’s activity may change from time to time from one function to another, such as from physical therapy to fitness, but normally users are focused on one major activity at a time. Thus, the same facility must accommodate a variety of needs simultaneously. As an example, a physical therapist rehabilitating a patient from an injury must be situated so as not to have difficulty communicating with the patient due to loud machine noise from the hydrotherapy area or disco music drifting in from the aerobics class around the corner. Each group of users expects to be treated with dignity and consideration, and designers must be aware and respond to these needs.\n",
      "\n",
      "Providers of these services expect the facility itself — its physical layout — to support the goals they establish. The facility can do that successfully only if the designers clearly understand the practice program and if they meet users’ expectations for a convenient, comfortable, and attractive environment.\n",

      "Token Chunk 438: # Convenient Access\n",
      "\n",
      "A center that is conveniently located, visible from the street, and easily accessible from the parking area will both enhance its marketing plan objectives and meet users’ expectations for convenience. A physical therapy patient, who faces an intensive six- or eight-week course of treatment, may be discouraged by difficult access or parking that involves too long a walk to the building entrance. These facilities can attract very high volumes of users especially if they also sell memberships to the fitness gym and pool.\n",
      "\n",
      "# Internal Layout — Need for Visibility\n",
      "\n",
      "In physical therapy, fitness, and medical treatment, visibility by staff is essential for safety and efficiency. In the physical therapy area, therapists may work with several patients, alternating from one to another. They may be applying a muscle stimulator to one person, cervical machine, and placing another one in a hydrotherapy whirlpool. Each of these patients, once set up, needs no further assistance until the 10- to 20-minute cycle has ended. Therapists are constantly circulating among patients in an open-plan area set up with physical therapy tables, exercise bikes, large mat tables, and private physical therapy rooms or cubicles partitioned with a curtain.\n",
      "\n",
      "In addition to circulating among patients, therapists often return to a central charting desk to record events on each patient’s record. Visibility is essential to controlling these activities. Therapists also must be able to watch the entry area to greet new patients who have arrived, and keep an eye on the hydrotherapy area, which is generally a separate room positioned so that visibility can be maintained.\n",
      "\n",
      "Token Chunk 439: The fitness area should be entirely open, so that staff can monitor use of equipment and weights and so that socializing can take place if users desire. An open plan enables exercise equipment to be arranged efficiently. It is important to have mirrors on any walls in the exercise area that do not contain wall-mounted equipment. Mirrors are not for vanity or for the purpose of expanding the room visually; they allow people using weight training equipment to make corrections in their form.\n",
      "\n",
      "If there is a medical practice associated with the facility, the area would be partitioned into examination or treatment rooms, private offices or consultation rooms, a minor surgery room, and a nurse station, which should be located so as to command surveillance over all treatment areas.\n",
      "\n",
      "A pool and spa, if provided, could be either indoors or outdoors, depending on the locale’s climate. The pool and spa generally command a high visual profile from an image-building standpoint, and they should be adjacent to the fitness area and locker/shower facilities.\n",

Jacuzzi pump noises can be reduced by surrounding pumps with an isolation closet.\n",
      "\n",
      "Token Chunk 441: The aerobics area should be fully separated by well-insulated partitions that run above the finished ceiling, since exercisers usually enjoy feeling the beat of the music. If the facility is not on the first floor, the designer must consider the effect of the aerobics activity on the tenants immediately below. The vibration caused by jumping and extremely loud music can be unbearable.\n",
      "\n",
      "# Aesthetics\n",
      "\n",
      "The aesthetic character of a sports medicine facility depends on the marketing philosophy, target population, locale, and budget. A facility that draws patients from within a controlled environment, such as member-physicians, contracted service to sports teams or corporate clients, or from referrals within a tightly knit medical office environment, would not generally need to invest in a high-profile design or use expensive materials to be successful.\n",
      "---\n",
      "On the other hand, a facility that concentrates on providing highly specialized services, which would draw from outside the immediate geographic area, or one that emphasizes memberships or establishes an exclusive character would be more likely to require an image-setting design treatment. Health clubs, for example, depend entirely on membership sales, and image is very important to their marketing effort. Generally, the higher the membership fee, the more elaborate the design treatment.\n",
      "\n",
      "Token Chunk 442: Wet Areas\n",
      "Areas wipin pe suite where significant moisture or wet activity is present should be carefully considered for moisture control, cross traffic, and noise. Obvious areas where moisture is present are spa areas, hydroperapy, shower rooms, and steam rooms. Not so obvious, but significant, are pe fitness gym and aerobics room, where high concentrations of vapor will occur due to heavy exertion and breaping. Wipout adequate ventilation, greater pan needed for normal use, pe area will seem “stuffy,” and mildew odors are likely to occur over a period of time in carpets and in areas where cleaning is difficult.\n",
      "Wip pe exception of hydroperapy, wet areas should be adjacent to one anoper or be connected by paps of moisture-resistant, slip-resistant flooring. Wet bodies or bare feet should not cross carpeting or areas of nonrelated activity. An oupoor pool may not be immediately adjacent to pe locker/shower rooms, but a pap of nonskid ceramic tile or slip-resistant rubber flooring can connect pem and provide spatial definition between areas of different functions wipout wall separations.\n",
      "Users of hydroperapy usually are dry and dressed before leaving pat area, so isolation may not be a problem. This must be evaluated on an individual basis to ensure proper adjacencies and traffic flow.\n",
      "All wet areas, including locker and dressing rooms adjacent to showers, toilet rooms, spa, and hydroperapy, should be supplied wip floor drains. A slight, almost imperceptible slope of 1⁄8 inch per foot toward strategically located floor drains may prevent a broken pipe or stuck valve from flooding carpet in adjacent areas.\n",
      "\n",
      "Token Chunk 443: Shower and steam rooms should have preshold water stops or dams of 1⁄2-inch maximum height (which must be beveled, maximum slope not to exceed 45 degrees) on pe wet side of pe entry, wip a floor slope pat directs water away from pe entry. Some shower or steam room doors have water troughs at pe bottom to prevent water from dripping off pe door. This water must be delivered somewhere and usually winds up at pe hinged edge, where floor slope is very difficult to control. At pis point, water will go everywhere, including to pe dry side, getting trampled into public areas by outgoing feet. One must pay special attention to wet floors.\n",
      "Rooms housing steam equipment should be well drained and ventilated, since steam generators create heat and present a hazard of leaking. Ventilation of pese same areas should be sized to prevent heat and moisture buildup.\n",
      "\n",
      "Token Chunk 444: Linen Storage\n",
      "A designer must be aware of pe copious amounts of linen used in pe daily routine of a sports medicine facility. Clean and soiled towels must be accommodated in locker rooms, as well as pe hydroperapy area. The physical perapy area uses linen sheets on pe tables, pillowcases, and towels. All of pis linen must be delivered, stored before and after use, and later picked up by pe linen service. The designer must be sure to provide adequate storage space for linen, plus additional ventilation to keep pat which is soiled and damp from becoming a nuisance. However, ventilation alone cannot overcome an environment pat is not kept clean and orderly wip soiled linen stowed in pe proper location.\n",

      "with changing from one material to another, because he or she will not be concentrating on the difference. The change could provide a hazardous surprise.\n",
      "\n",
      "For wet areas, ceramic tile is the most favored flooring for design application, durability, and surface texture. However, contrary to public perception, ceramic tile is not always easy to clean. Light-colored grout is almost impossible to keep clean. The larger the tile, the fewer the grout joints. Sheet vinyl is an option of compromise to be used in damp areas when budget is a consideration. In hydrotherapy, sheet vinyl is quite suitable, preferably with a self-coved base. The designer should note whether heavy portable tanks will be used. They could compress and destroy a flooring material not designed for heavy loads. Vinyl composition tile, because of its many seams, is undesirable in high-moisture areas.\n",
      "\n",
      "Token Chunk 445: Vinyl wallcovering is ideal in a sports medicine facility because it offers great variety in texture as well as ease of cleaning. If paint is used, it must be semigloss or eggshell enamel, fully washable. Painted wall graphics can be especially appealing in this type of facility. The reader is referred to Color Plate 31, \n",
      "\n",
      "# Lighting\n",
      "\n",
      "Treatment areas within the facility normally require broadly distributed lighting of 30 to 50 footcandles. Under ideal conditions, the physical therapy area would have indirect or ambient lighting. Fixtures might be suspended from the ceiling, with the light shining on and bouncing off the ceiling, creating an overall high level of diffused illumination without casting glare in the eyes of patients lying on physical therapy tables. In the hydrotherapy area, fitness gym, and aerobics room, on the other hand, the standard 2-4-foot fluorescent troffer with a parabolic low-brightness lens would be appropriate. The reception area, lobby, or corridors might benefit from accent lighting focusing on wall-graphics, special artwork, or educational exhibits. Other chapters of this book provide detailed information on lighting medical spaces such as exam rooms, minor surgery, and nurse stations. Specifically, refer to Chapter 13.\n",

Usually referred by a physician, patients arrive for an initial evaluation, followed by a series of visits that may range from one to three times per week. For each patient, a routine is established that quickly becomes familiar. Some patients have to warm up by riding an exercise bike for 10 minutes prior to starting therapy and, after checking in with the receptionist, they proceed to the gym and set themselves up without the therapist greeting them. First-time visitors will wait in the reception room until called by the therapist.\n",

Since the pharmacy’s primary (and in some cases, total) source of business is the tenants in the buildings, it is wise not to plan the pharmacy’s space until the tenants and their respective specialties are known. If the medical office building is isolated and not adjacent to neighborhood foot traffic, the pharmacy’s referrals will come exclusively from the medical office building. However, if the pharmacy was in business in the neighborhood before moving into the new medical building, chances are a certain amount of outside business will follow the pharmacist to the new location due to loyalty or to prior business arrangements.\n",

      "Thus, it is necessary to analyze the source and number of prescriptions, both new and refills. Once the tenant population is known, the volume of prescriptions can be analyzed. A general practitioner or internist will see 25 to 35 patients per day, and perhaps two-thirds of those patients will be given a prescription. Certain specialties tend to generate more prescriptions than others. When the estimated number of prescriptions (or “scripts”) to be derived from the tenant population has been determined, one must speculate on what percentage of those scripts will end up at the building’s pharmacy. If physicians in the building like the pharmacist, if the pharmacist provides a comfortable place for patients to wait while a prescription is being filled, and if the pharmacy is located so that patients have to pass it upon exiting the building, one may anticipate a certain percent of the building’s scripts will be filled at the building’s pharmacy.

In dentistry, with the exception of oral surgery, endodontics (root canal), and sometimes periodontics (gum surgery), many treatments are done less for curing disease and restoring health than for quality of life. For this reason, cosmetic (esthetic) dentistry has been on the rise in recent years.\n",

This prevents many from seeking anything other than emergency care for an abscess, root canal, or periodontal disease that may have progressed to an advanced state. These individuals do not seek elective procedures or cosmetic dentistry. However, if they have a positive treatment experience that is relatively painless and interventions are in place to relax them and to reduce stress, it is possible to change their negative childhood associations. The overall ambience of the office from the time they enter the waiting room is the first line of defense. First impressions do matter.

Some of these amenities include an electric massage pad laid on the dental chair, heated aromatherapy pillows, a warm blanket, chairside CD player with headphones, virtual-reality glasses, ceiling-recessed monitor with video movies, hot towels and fruit juice at the end of treatment, a frozen-yogurt machine, the aroma of freshly baked bread for early-morning arrivals, and a great selection of magazines. Research shows clearly that having options and choices reduces stress and one of those choices should be “no bells and whistles.” In the end, it is competent and caring staff and building relationships with patients that really results in financial success. Dentists’ Internet Web sites are rife with anecdotal reports of imaginative things that have been implemented to comfort and entertain patients, but they usually end with the admonition: They did not increase revenue or patient base although that’s really not the fundamental reason for doing them. They, as well as numerous practice management gurus who run seminars, advise that well-trained staff who are courteous and trained in understanding different personality types and how they react in stressful situations will prove to be a long-term asset. Nevertheless, it is worthwhile to distract and entertain patients in the treatment room as a considerable body of research demonstrates that such diversions are highly effective in reducing stress, especially in a clinical setting.\n",

      "Token Chunk 471: INTERVIEW QUESTIONNAIRE—AN IMPORTANT DESIGN TOOL and equipment. Prior to filling out the questionnaire, a general discussion should occur relevant to the doctor’s long-term goals — perhaps a 10-year plan. Is the goal to bring partners into the practice, to get this one going and then open other locations, or to retire in 10 years and sell the practice? This information will influence the project budget, space allocation, room for growth, and equipment selections. The information gathered from the questionnaire can be translated into an effective space-planning program. Occasionally dentists moving into new offices will bring outdated dental equipment with them, which might necessitate a less-than-optimal treatment room layout. Others buy sleek, state-of-the-art equipment that allows the designer to create an efficient treatment room. This chapter will acquaint the designer with the equipment and general requirements for the practices of general dentistry (including prosthodontics and cosmetic dentistry), pediatric dentistry (pedodontics), orthodontics, periodontics, oral surgery, and endodontics. While guidelines will be given, remember that the organization of dental offices is somewhat less standardized than that of medical facilities, owing to the number of options in size and design of the operatory or treatment room. The equipment, the location of casework, and the preferred style of delivery of instrumentation (rear, over the patient, or side) will determine the size and layout of the treatment room. As an aside, the preferred term for operatory is now “treatment room” unless surgery is performed there, as in oral surgery, although many dentists still use the term “operatory.” Therefore, although there is an optimal design of a treatment room, other choices will also be presented. That which is common to all dental suites will be discussed under General Dentistry. Modifications required for other dental specialties will be discussed thereafter.\n",

This is affected by the shape of the space, the location of structural columns, as well as the overall dimensions of the area and perhaps the desire to have north light in the treatment rooms. A wiser course of action is to meet with a space planner prior to committing to the space. If the configuration of the space results in an awkward layout, undersized treatment rooms, and poor adjacencies with respect to critical functions such as sterilization and overall flow through the office, it is better to recognize these conditions early rather than have to live with them for the next 10 years. Another space in the building may be available that would result in a better layout. As dentists know well, efficiency makes a tremendous difference, whether it is a convenient reaching distance while seated at the dental chair, the number of staff it takes to run the office, or the resulting stress inefficiency places on the dentist and chairside assistants as they move through a busy schedule.\n",

If the dentist uses general anesthesia (oral surgery, pediatric, or restorative/esthetic dentistry cases), this triggers many code issues as the patient is deemed “at risk for loss of life-preserving protective reflexes.” In some states, the use of general anesthesia mandates licensing by the department of health services, Medicare certification, or accreditation by a recognized agency.

Other jurisdictions require 36-inch clearance on all sides of the dental chair as well as wheelchair clearance under every sink in a treatment room. It has been reported to the author (but not verified) that OSHA has an interpretive newsletter that, in essence, states that task-oriented stand-up workstations at the ADA limit of 34-inch height can injure the worker’s back. As a result, in some jurisdictions sterilization workstations are approved at 36-inch height. Dentists are accustomed to packing a lot into small spaces. Tiny darkrooms, labs, or break rooms with doors opening into the room barely scraping the edge of the cabinet are no longer possible under the Americans with Disabilities Act design restrictions.

This is ostensibly to alert employees not to reach into these waste containers unprotected or to handle the waste during disposal without proper barriers in place. The EPA, however, does not consider the same waste, in general, as hazardous after it leaves the dental office. The concentration of blood and saliva is seldom significant enough to cause a health hazard. The problem lies in the misinterpretation of how to dispose of the waste.

Some states have misinterpreted this requirement and mandated that the operator be able to see the patient during any X-ray exposure. It is important to check requirements with the state agency and then provide a location for the operator that allows viewing of the patient from behind an approved barrier or from a distance 6 feet away from the radiation source and never in the primary beam trajectory.

The CEREC takes an electronic “impression” (no gooey impression material in the mouth), and the computer creates the restoration. Using an adhesive bonding technique, the dentist inserts the filling into the tooth or cements the crown. This eliminates having to send the impressions to a lab and waiting a couple of weeks for return of the crown. The conventional material for crowns is porcelain fused to metal, whereas the CEREC (chairside economical restorations of esthetic ceramics) uses ceramic material. There is some debate about whether ceramic crowns have the subtlety of coloration and artistry produced by the finest porcelain laboratories. Today, dentists have the capability of sending the laboratory a digital color photo of a patient’s mouth with the standard tooth-matching color guide included in the photo as a visual reference to correct for differences in color reproduction on the monitor and/or printer receiving the image at the lab.

Thus, many treatment rooms have no doors to facilitate movement. The ADA limitations on door sizes, clearances, and swings make it almost impossible to legally put a door on a treatment room. Number of Sinks. A treatment room may have one or two sinks, wall hung or, more commonly, built into fixed cabinets. There is a trend toward one sink that functions for both the dentist and the assistant and can even serve two operatories as in Color Plate 33,  In some regions, water and sewer fees are so high that it is more practical to use fewer sinks, placing them where they are convenient for several individuals, without compromising infection control.

There is a considerably longer depreciation schedule for writing off tenant improvements compared with modular casework, which is considered furniture and can be written off over a five-year period. In addition, there is a considerable element of coordination when relying on a local casework fabricator. Casework is a long lead-time item; final measurements can’t be taken until the partitions have been completed. The coordination of electrical and other utilities with the casework is the stuff that will invoke “Murphy’s Law.” And it all has to come together at the last minute. The dental equipment dealer has to wait until the casework is delivered to the job in order to fit the equipment and connect all the elements. Electrical, medical gas, and mechanical subcontractors also have to coordinate their work to bring wiring and utilities to outlets built into the casework.

      "Location of Computers and Ergonomic Considerations. There is general agreement that the ideal treatment room needs two computers and two monitors. A third monitor may be mounted in the ceiling for patient viewing in a reclined position. The first computer is usually located somewhere in the vicinity of the assistant with a screen not visible by the patient for the assistant to chart on, bring up management information, and record treatments. This computer can also be used to capture digital X-ray images and intra-or extraoral photographic images from digital cameras. The second computer is usually located where it is more convenient for the doctor or hygienist to manipulate, and the monitor is placed in as ideal a position as possible for patient viewing while sitting upright in the patient\n",

      "chair. This second system is used for patient education with DVDs of prepared topics, for screening of patient X-rays, for explanation of their personal conditions and possible treatments (using photographs), and sometimes just for entertainment purposes. The overhead monitor is usually slaved to the second computer and allows the same functions when the patient is reclined for treatment. This additionally allows patients to watch the actual examination of their oral conditions if they so desire.\n",
      "\n",
      "Token Chunk 516: Variables for Monitor Placement. Ergonomics are really important in the dental treatment room and yet dentists are often unaware of these issues when deciding where to place monitors. In theory, the dentist should focus on the oral cavity and, by merely looking up, be able to see the display on the monitor, pointing out problem areas to the patient (Therefore, if the patient’s monitor is placed on the left side, either near the foot of the chair ( If it is post mounted or on a radius arm that moves around the toe of the chair ( The patient monitor (often a Sony TV) should be 17 or 20 inches in size so that it can be viewed from a distance. If it is post mounted, as in  One must be mindful of patients who wear bifocals and their ability to see images clearly or read text from a specific viewing distance.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another option for a patient monitor is in the ceiling, immediately over the patient chair. Since the chair is laid almost flat while the dentist is working, this makes it quite easy for the patient to view educational or entertainment programming ( A competent audiovisual consultant or dealer can design a bracket to securely mount the monitor and handle all the installation. There needs to be a flange or a trim piece around it to provide a finished edge on the ceiling, whether it is gypsum board or acoustic tile. Practice Management Monitor. The primary computer, used by the assistant, is best located at the rear of the chair in what is called the 12 o’clock position. This enables the assistant to see exactly what the dentist is seeing in the oral cavity, and it also has practice management software, providing full access to the patient’s chart, notes, and radiographs. The monitor should be positioned so that the dentist can also view this information. During the procedure, the assistant will input data with a light pen, touch pad, pen and tablet, or wireless infrared keyboard and mouse. A second input device to the side of the dentist enables him or her to access information or manipulate X-rays without having to verbally ask the assistant to do it in the patient’s presence. This also enables the dentist to review the treatment plan or read previous appointment notes discreetly on the assistant’s monitor. The dentist in  The patient shares this monitor.\n",

      "Token Chunk 517: Types of Monitors and Their Purposes. A computer monitor is specifically designed to process text and other information that is processed digitally. It has phenomenal clarity for text or computer-generated graphics. It also does a great job displaying digital X-rays or still photographs. However, it usually doesn’t provide a good picture for “moving” video. The picture typically looks “pixelized” and somewhat dark. Flat-screen monitors typically look even worse, with washed-out pictures and diluted colors. Flat-screen monitors are usually LCD (liquid crystal display) screens and are much more costly than the CRT screens most of us are used to. Intraoral camera images are also usually washed out on a flat LCD-type computer monitor. Most computer monitors require the computer to process video through a video input card such as the ATI All-in-Wonder or Matrox. Some monitors (very few) offer inputs for both a computer and video. The video input on the monitor provides for additional flexibility, but, in most cases, still doesn’t provide the same picture quality as a television monitor for video. Television monitors typically provide a better picture for viewing video, but have unacceptable resolution for reading text or viewing some graphics. Intraoral cameras work very well on television monitors and digital X-rays are\n",
      "---\n",
      "Somewhat viewable. A television monitor should be used when the screen is primarily used for watching video, such as cable or satellite TV, background video, VCR, or a standalone DVD player. Most doctors feel that the television is adequate for showing digital X-rays to the patient, but not adequate for diagnosis. Computer monitors offer better detail for digital X-rays.\n",
      "\n",
      "Token Chunk 518: Like computer monitors, television monitors are also available as flat screens. Flat-panel displays are considerably more expensive than normal CRT-type screens and usually do not have a picture equal to CRT screens. Liquid crystal display screens are available up to about 22 inches. Screens larger than 5 inches diagonally increase dramatically in price as the size increases.\n",
      "\n",
      "Video “glasses” are composed of two small LCD screens that are mounted on an eyeglass frame. The glasses provide a somewhat low-resolution picture for video and a totally unacceptable picture for computer. The glasses are typically equipped with stereo headphones that hang from the temples. Patients often find video glasses novel, but many feel claustrophobic or cut off from their surroundings. Doctors also sometimes feel cut off from the patient since they can’t see the patient’s eyes or expressions. The glasses need a source such as a VCR or DVD to provide a picture. Video glasses are affordable but may require maintenance, as they are constantly being handled, dropped, or tugged on by patients.\n",
      "\n",
      "Other Ergonomic Considerations. An additional concern is eyestrain. Every time the dentist’s eyes move from the oral cavity to the monitor, the pupil has to dilate or constrict (and this happens less rapidly with increasing age) to differing light levels and the focal length of the eye must adjust to the distance; eye muscles have to bend the lens. These physiological factors should be considered when placing objects in the treatment room. Note also, in considering ergonomics and back strain, that touch-pad programmable dental chairs are available to enable the dentist to quickly adjust the chair by presetting it for different positions. Operating microscopes, discussed previously, significantly reduce head and neck strain.\n",

      "Token Chunk 519: Audio and Video Possibilities. As a result of being one of those individuals who experienced frightening dental visits as a child, Keith Aderman, professionally known as “Mr. Hookup” (www.mrhookup.net), has developed what he refers to as “architectural electronics” specifically for the dental profession. He firmly believes that positive distractions relax patients and enable them to avail themselves of the dental care they need without the fear factor. He integrates, into a highly sophisticated system, a number of media elements that include satellite TV, music with no commercials, and a variety of educational programming, all remote controlled by the patient. Monitors are securely held in ceilings, over the patient’s head, with a proprietary-designed bracket (designed to support considerably more weight than a TV for safety), while communication and media control panels are neatly recessed at the 12 o’clock wall. A satellite receiver for each treatment room is connected to a common 18-inch dish on the roof of the building, and stereo headphones provide the TV with quality sound. The picture shown on the TV can be duplicated on a computer screen for upright viewing (provided the computer screen is within the patient’s view), which also works well for intraoral camera use. Competent execution of wiring and switching to integrate all the elements of the audio and video system to make it user friendly is essential.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sometimes, large television monitors are used. However, new flat-screen computer monitors can display both analog video images from the intraoral camera, VCR, and broadcast TV and digital images in the form of DVD output and digital X-ray; both types of images can even be displayed simultaneously. Because they are closer to the patient, they don’t have to be as large as wall-mounted monitors. In addition, the practitioner does not have to use a laser pointer, but can merely use his or her hand to direct the patient’s attention to the image.\n",

The wiring that connects computers to monitors, intraoral cameras, and communication devices, as well as audio and video media, is complex and requires carefully planned prewiring during construction to tie into the central media station, which may also be the equipment room containing the telephone system and central data hub. Of course, it can also be done in existing offices, but it may not be as “clean” an installation.

With the computer, one can add text explaining the picture or add a print of the X-ray, all on the same piece of paper. No printer switcher is required, nor is any special intraoral camera video wiring. One set of audio and video cables is required from the central media station for each source that is located there to be provided to each operatory. Sources that may be centrally located might include a satellite receiver, a VCR or DVD player dedicated to each operatory, a central DVD player shared among multiple operatories for interactive patient education, or a central DVD player shared among all the operatories for relaxing background videos accompanied by relaxing music.\n",

An enhanced category 5 wire (which some companies refer to as category 6 or 7) is desirable as it is capable of transferring data at 350 megabytes per second. Competent System Design Essential Dental software must be carefully chosen and computer systems skillfully designed and integrated, to be maximally effective. One should be able to control which data appear on which screen. Increasingly, developers of dental software are recognizing the need to design solutions for multiple monitors. Dentrix®, EagleSoft, PracticeWorks and Dentsply SoftDent are four of the most popular software systems.

      "Token Chunk 525: Integra Medical Lighting Good lighting is mandatory in a dental operatory. It is crit- ical to use full-spectrum fluorescent lamps with a color rendering index (CRI) of 90 or more and color temperature (measured in kelvins) of 5500, sometimes referred to as “Natural Daylight.” Refer to Chapter 13 for more details on the technical aspects of lighting and for photos of exem- plary lighting solutions. The indirect “basket” recessed flu- orescent luminaire referred to in  Lithonia’s Avante series and Focal Point’s Luna series are two options for this type of lighting ( The illumination should be free of shadows, and a brightness ratio of 4 : 1 should be maintained with the operating light or at least a minimum 10 : 1 ratio.

Thus, the work counters and visual background of the room must receive 600 to 650 maintained footcandles. Handpiece fiber-optic illumination requires bright rooms to prevent “optical bounce,” a term that refers to the continual opening and shutting of the iris of the eye due to extreme brightness differences. Optical bounce causes headaches and eyestrain as the dentist shifts focus from a bright mouth to an overly dark room.

      "Token Chunk 527: Color as a Functional Tool. The dental chair and fixed casework and mobile carts should be selected in colors that coordinate with the room’s interior design. Light, neutral colors used for cabinetry and dental units make them blend into the background and be less obtrusive. But there is a more important functional issue that should inform color selections in a dental treatment room, namely, reflectance. The previous section on lighting explained the optimal 4 : 1 ratio between ambient light and the bright halogen light at the oral cavity. It is increasingly difficult to achieve this ratio with energy restrictions on watts per square foot, which means that dark colors (which absorb light) should be avoided in favor of those that reflect light. This also avoids eyestrain since strong contrast forces the focal length of the eye to adjust rapidly. In practical terms, this means that the dramatic black or charcoal gray treatment room casework sometimes favored by dentists who want to make a design statement is creating a visually stressful environment in which to work. It’s also harder to see dirt on dark surfaces and, therefore, to clean it. Select colors carefully for a treatment room, considering the color reflectance cast onto the patient’s teeth.\n",
      "\n",
      "Vision research indicates that there should ideally be little contrast among the casework color, the walls, and the floor. A dark floor with light walls and casework creates eyestrain.

This does not preclude running vacuum piping overhead to treatment rooms from a pump located basically at the same floor level as the treatment rooms. While this is less desirable than running vacuum piping under the floor in question, it may have to be used in some instances. If your design requires overhead vacuum piping, be sure to consult the manufacturer’s design specifications for piping to be connected to the pumps to ensure an efficient system. The vacuum pump shown in  The vacuum system is sized according to the number of HVEs and saliva ejectors that might be in use at any one time.

      "Air abrasion as a technique or technology has been discussed previously, but it should be mentioned that the portable units have their own on-board compressors typically functioning at 90 to 132 pounds per square inch. Typically, central office air compression is not high enough to run one of these units. However, it is possible to install a high-pressure compressor in the equipment room with lines running to each operatory. This enables one to have an air abrasion handpiece chairside, mounted on the standard handpiece delivery system. This is difficult to retrofit into existing offices but is an option for new construction. The remote-control head on each delivery system controls pressure and powder flow rates. It is possible to install this in an existing space if there is a crawlspace or basement. Air abrasion as a technique is sometimes maligned because of the powder overspray (the technique is similar to sandblasting), which creates considerable cleanup after the procedure. However, more expensive, top-of-the-line models meter the powder into the air stream with more precision. Education about proper evacuation and operating techniques is also important.\n",

State professional practice acts and local building codes generally dictate in what types of situations emergency power is required. For example, in most jurisdictions, oral surgeons would require emergency power. Generators cannot be used if they are not located on the ground floor, but high-capacity battery backup may be used; however, one must be careful about what else is on that circuit.

It should be large enough for two or three people to work in it simultaneously, depending on the number of treatment rooms served. An area that is too small will cause stress for those who have to work there, which, in some cases, is a dedicated sterilization technician who wipes down the operatories and handles instrument sterilization. Sterilization can also be performed in a large alcove off of the corridor. Casework may be custom built or a prefabricated modular system specifically designed for dental sterilization. A sterilization area or room is typically 8 feet wide by 10 feet long; 16 lineal feet of countertop or work surface is considered the minimum to adequately perform the tasks of sterilization. Typically, with an engineered modular system, one can accommodate more equipment in less space.\n",

There is also a trend toward standard dental lights mounted either on the chair or on the ceiling, providing better lighting with more variable positioning. The location of fixed and mobile cabinets is critical to enable the orthodontist and assistant to move quickly from one patient to the next. Orthodontic treatment rooms have very little fixed cabinetry, compared to pediatric or general dentistry treatment rooms. Orthodontists do not use as many dynamic instruments as general dentists, and it is not uncommon to see custom-designed cabinets to the side or rear of the patient chair with instrumentation built in. The style of delivery is often over the patient, but could be rear delivery. Neither nitrous oxide nor oxygen is generally needed, only suction and air.\n",

      "Pediatric dentistry (sometimes called pedodontics) is the branch of dentistry that specializes in children. It is based on a philosophy of prevention. If the child’s teeth are maintained properly from an early age, there will be fewer problems as the child grows older. Thus, children from the ages of 2 to 18 visit pediatric dentists. Since the children are so young, much of the instruction and care of the child’s teeth is entrusted to the parent. The parent must learn how to floss and brush the toddler’s teeth until the child is old enough to do it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thus, a patient education room is required and sometimes has a built-in bench so that the parent can be seated with the child’s head in his or her lap and the child’s body stretched out on the bench. The bench simulates a couch or bed at home, where plaque control is done with a dry toothbrush, without paste or water. The dental assistant sits near the parent and guides him or her during the procedure. The room should also have a built-in cabinet with sink, a large mirror, and good illumination.\n",

      "A child and parent, on the initial visit, are escorted to the treatment room where the child’s teeth are X-rayed and examined. As an alternative, there may be a centrally located intraoral X-ray machine as well as one in each “quiet” room. Then the parent may visit with the doctor in a consultation room, or perhaps remain in the treatment room, to discuss the course of treatment, followed by a stop at the finance office to discuss the cost. Pediatric dentists often do interceptive orthodontics on 5- to 12-year-olds using fixed and removable appliances to grow and shape the bones of the upper and lower jaw to fit the teeth into, rather than waiting until they stop growing and then extracting teeth to make room. This type of work involves case presentations similar to orthodontics.\n",

      "Token Chunk 572: Since visits are typically short, this tends to be a high-volume practice. Thus, the circulation of patients should be direct and well planned, and things that little children should not touch should be behind closed doors. The waiting room must be large since each child is accompanied by one or both parents and, often, one or more siblings. A three-chair operatory bay may account for as many as 14 persons in the waiting room. The number of people in the waiting room is sometimes a function of the socioeconomic composition of the practice. Families with low incomes who cannot afford babysitters tend to bring all the children when one of them has to visit the dentist.\n",

Sometimes, a third assistant may be present during the procedure to handle a fiber-optic light, if used, although the doctor may wear a fiber-optic headlamp. A solo practitioner would have two treatment operatories with a third one for post-op visits or emergency care; however, the solo practice shown in An endodontist has an intraoral X-ray unit in each operatory, but there is no need for a panoramic or cephalometric X-ray within the suite. An automatic processor is used for developing some X-rays, but it takes too long to process the working films done during treatment. For those, assistants use a portable chairside developer process, enabling them to develop a single film in 30 seconds, that is, unless they have switched to digital, which provides immediate images on the monitor. Digital imaging has become so widespread that the prior requirement for one darkroom for each dentist, unique to this specialty, will not be addressed. Some endodontists use an electronic device to measure the length of the root canal, thereby reducing the need for working X-rays during treatment. The reader is referred to the General Dentistry section of this chapter for additional discussion of X-ray and darkroom.\n",

In the process of doing routine root canal treatment, the following items are commonly used: an apex locator, an electric torque-control motor, an ultra-sonic unit, a touch-n-heat unit, and an Obtura gutta-percha gun (or a System B heat source). These devices are in addition to the normal high- and low-speed handpieces and the air/water syringe. Each of these devices has a base and a handpiece that must be easily accessed as well as a separate electrical plug. Therefore, there is a space management issue. This has been addressed by various companies by incorporating all of these devices (including the regular handpieces) into a separate four-wheeled cart.\n",

      "In early civilizations, man made color holy. He saw intimations of life’s mysteries in the spectrum, and assigned it power — so that each color became emblematic of divine forces in a world that so integrated art, ritual, and myths with everyday life that each was suffused with the other. Color was a language in itself; hieroglyphic paintings of vibrant blues, reds, greens, and purples could be interpreted as clearly as words are today. Recent comparative cultural studies have shown similar symbolic uses of color among peoples who could not possibly have had contact with one another. Birren,* a noted color historian, has reported that the points of the compass in China, for example, were represented by black for north, white for west, red for south, and green for east, and that the people of ancient Ireland and also the Indians of North America used identical designations.\n",

      "Now the old myths have been dismissed as superstition; color has been stripped of its early and specific symbolism; we can no longer precisely “read” a color painting. It is the task of psychologists and mythologists to plumb the depths of the human consciousness from which came those primal myths, and from which our dreams still come, so that we may arrive at a greater knowledge of our common inner life. It is also important to learn how color has always held humankind in its sway — so much so that we hallucinate\n",

      "gauge scientifically its specific influences upon our behavior. The color gold no longer carries the power of the Egyptian sun-god, but research indicates that its perception does have an effect upon the entire human organism, not only the optic nerve. And the implications of this — the differentiated influences of colors, real and measurable — are manifold in regard to environmental design and just beginning to be recognized.\n",
      "\n",
      "The history of color theory and research is long and variegated, with most of the early work done by philosophers and artists. Aristotle was the first to pose a systematic theory of color, one that is no longer considered relevant. In the early part of the eighteenth century, the German poet Goethe expressed his views on color harmony and the symbolic values of color in his book, Farbenlehre. The most obvious weakness of Goethe’s work was that of most color studies before the twentieth century; he dealt with hues, failing to consider saturation and brightness. Nevertheless, he did make an observation that — scores of studies and tests later — has been accepted as valid: that red, yellow, and orange — longer-wavelength colors at the warm end of the spectrum — are exciting and “advancing” colors; they seem to come toward one and draw one out, while blue, green, and purple — shorter wavelength colors at the cool end of the spectrum — are “retreating” colors and induce a more quieting, inward-drawing response.\n",

      "rather than vigorous scientific investigation. Nineteenth-century artist Odilon Redon made dazzling explorations into color. Other artists famous for their research in color theory include Paul Klee, Wasily Kandinsky, and Josef Albers. Dozens of others — among the more well known are Munsell, Ostwald, Chevreul, Bezold, and Wundt — toward the close of the nineteenth century and the beginning of the twentieth, postulated color theories and laws of harmony along less subjective lines than the often empirical studies of the artists. In the first quarter of the twentieth century, investigators even began testing color preferences for many different groups of people.\n",

      "# COLOR PREFERENCE TESTS\n",
      "\n",
      "The obstacles confronting all of these color preference enthusiasts, however, were considerable: Color samples were not yet standardized, nor were their backgrounds, nor the light of their viewing conditions similarly controlled. Furthermore, there is difficulty inherent in any test of color and “affect,” or feeling — since an individual does not respond to a hue as pure color, but as something that evokes myriad and unique associations with objects and with experiences, which are psychological processes that resist measurement. It is hardly surprising, then, that in 1925 one well-known researcher reviewed the mass of contradictory preference findings in his own and others’ studies and declared that all hope of finding consistent reactions to color would have to be abandoned.\n",
      "\n",
      "Token Chunk 592: It was not. In the 75 years since that pessimistic dictum, a great variety of studies on color responses has been conducted. The number of color preference studies — on normal people, mentally disabled people, psychotics, males, females, the old, the young, in all parts of the world — is probably equal to the total of all other studies on “color and affect” combined. While the findings are often contradictory, certain agreement has been reached among numerous investigators. The difficulty in testing for color preference lies in not being able to control the many variables. Too many articles have been published on the results of market research, and these findings represent current fads rather than scientific investigation. Many of the “conclusions” extracted from these spurious studies are either obvious or dubious.\n",
      "\n",
      "Color preferences develop as a reaction to culture, education, experience, and genetics. People see the world in different ways and process the environment according to their own needs and drives. Thus, it has been postulated that there is a relationship between a person's color responses and his or her emotional state. But it is difficult to test reactions to color because so much depends on the subject’s verbal assessment of what he or she sees, and colors are so symbolic, carrying highly personal connotations. If, as a child, a person had always been punished in a blue room, that person may dislike blue as an adult. Therefore, any studies of color preference on “normal” subjects must be based on large samples so that individual biases due to highly personal experiences do not bias the results of the study, which may have been designed to test cultural color preferences, age color preferences, or some variable other than pathologically based color preferences or aversions. There is also the physiological problem that people often do not see a color alike. One person may see a dark green as having more yellow; another may see it as having more blue.\n",
      "\n",
      "Token Chunk 593: Because the color preferences of adults are so much a result of learning, many researchers have preferred to work with children to minimize the effects of learning and experience. Various studies have corroborated that young children prefer the warm, exciting colors of red and yellow, but when they get older they prefer cool colors — blues and greens — as they become less impulsive and more reflective and intellectual.\n",
      "\n",
      "The researcher Ellis, however, noted in primitive societies a continuing preference for the brilliant hues of red and yellow from childhood into adulthood — and hypothesized that “the apparent trend away from yellow as a revered color among early Greeks and Romans was largely due to the taboo placed upon it by the Christian church, as the symbol of sin and gaiety.” Another\n",

      "researcher in the preference field, T. R. Garth, conducted tests among children of six different groups — white, Black, American Indian, Filipino, Japanese, and Mexican — and found that the preference differences were minimal among them; he concluded that the differences that do appear in adulthood are due to factors related to nurturing.\n",
      "\n",
      "Eysenck, in a critical review of numerous other color preference studies conducted all over the world, and also of his own experiments, concluded that there is a high degree of agreement among investigators, and that a general order of preference is as follows: blue, red, green, violet, orange, and yellow. He furthermore concluded that there are no sex differences, apart from a slight preference among women for yellow over orange, and among men for orange over yellow.\n",
      "\n",
      "Token Chunk 594: How can such uniformity of color preference be explained? Researchers Guilford and Smith have attributed it to innate biological factors, while others have emphasized the role of culture, learning, and experience. The truth probably lies in a balance between the two, a combination of innate and cultural factors. In other words, it is not yet known exactly what determines color preferences, only that a marked similarity does exist among all peoples.\n",

      "# COLOR-FORM PREFERENCE\n",
      "\n",
      "In child-development evaluation, various color-form preference categorization tests are among the most often used measures of the abstraction phenomenon — that ability to single out specific elements from a pattern on the basis of similar factors. The classic color-form preference of measure has been used mainly with young children, and it has demonstrated that most children reach the peak of color dominance around four and a half, that the median age of transition from color to form dominance is five, and that form dominance is usually established by the age of nine.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Rorschach inkblot method has also been used, with its results consistently showing that pure color responses dominate among young children; color-form dominates in the older child; and from late childhood through adolescence and adulthood, form-color responses dominate. Explanations for the color-form dominance phenomenon include maturation, increased personality differentiation from the affective to the intellectual, increased meaningfulness of the environment in terms of utility, less concern for primitive characteristics, increased verbal skills, and introduction to reading and writing.\n",
      "\n",
      "Token Chunk 595: Furthermore, since 90 percent of the adult population is form-dominant, color-dominant persons have been considered deviates. One of the most commonly held theories is that since color is a primitive response, the adult color-dominant personality is impulsive, immature, egocentric, and less intelligent than his or her form-dominant and therefore mature, socially adjusted peers. Children who retain their color dominance after classmates have switched over, therefore, are considered regressive and are subjected to academic and cultural programs to change their orientation.\n",

      "What is interesting, however, is that some recent studies of creativity have indicated that the color-oriented child is more likely to emerge as an artistic, creative adult, far more innovative than his or her form-dominant peers, who will tend to deal well with analytical work in the traditional mold. One of the ingredients of that creative ability is to be free of that mold, to see with fresh eyes and envision new relationships, untried combinations. If further studies support this theory, then it will be clear that a disservice has been done to those who have not fit the conventional mold, and who should be encouraged in their different way rather than pressed into a constricting and uniform shape.\n",

      "# COLOR AND MENTAL DISORDERS\n",
      "\n",
      "A variety of color tests — among them the Rorschach and the color pyramid test, devised by Swiss psychologist Max Pfister in 1950 — are used as diagnostic tools in determining normality/abnormality. Because so many tests involving color preference, response, and placement have been performed on the mentally and emotionally ill, with such a plethora of conflicting results, it is clear that the data must be interpreted cautiously and in conjunction with those from other tests. The most abused area here is probably preference, as some have not hesitated to link preference for specific colors to specific disorders, in irresponsible and unproven attribution. Eric P. Mosse, as quoted in Birren, reveals:\n",
      "\n",
      "Token Chunk 597: We generally found in hysterical patients, especially in psychoneuroses with anxiety states, a predilection for green as symbolizing the mentioned escape mechanism. . . . Red is the color of choice of the hypomaniac patient giving the tumult of his emotions their “burning” and “bloody” expression. And we don’t wonder that melancholia and depression reveal themselves through a complete “blackout.” Finally, we see yellow as the color of schizophrenia. . . . This yellow is the proper and intrinsic color of the morbid mind. Whenever we observe its accumulative appearance, we may be sure we are dealing with a deep-lying psychotic disturbance.\n",
      "\n",
      "Birren, a noted color historian, disagrees. “Yellow may be looked upon as an intellectual color associated both with great intelligence and mental deficiency.” He claims that schizophrenics prefer blue. The contradictions are legion. A study done by Warner, in which 300 patients were tested, including diagnosed anxiety neurotics, catatonic schizophrenics, manics, and depressives, found in most cases no significant correlation of preference with psychiatric disorders.\n",
      "\n",
      "How does the Rorschach contribute to clinical diagnosis? Rorschach’s hypothesis was that color responses are measures of the affective, or emotional, state, and he noted that neurotics are subject to “color shock” (rejection), as manifested in a delayed reaction time when presented with a color blot. He also stated that red evoked the shock response in neurotics more often than did other colors. Schizophrenics also suffer color shock when presented with the chromatic or color cards (following the black and white cards) of the Rorschach. Birren postulates that color may represent an unwanted intrusion into their inner life.\n",
      "\n",
      "Token Chunk 598: In the realm of color research, however, nothing goes uncontested, and the Rorschach is no exception. Two major criticisms of it are the lack of work with normal subjects as a criterion against which pathological groups could be compared, and also the basic postulate that the way in which a person responds to color in inkblots reflects his or her typical mode of dealing with, or integrating, affect. In fact, researchers Cerbus and Nichols, in trying to replicate Rorschach’s findings, found no correlation between color responsiveness and impulsivity, and no significant difference in use of color by neurotics, schizophrenics, and normals. Nevertheless, the weight of evidence still favors the Rorschach color-affect theory.\n",

      "\n",
      "Seen in another manner, the depressive’s attraction for bright colors may be an expression of homeostasis — the organism’s subconscious striving for balance or equilibrium.\n",
      "\n",
      "Biological or physiological reactions to color are the most susceptible to testing and the most valuable from a pragmatic point of view, particularly in relation to design. Kurt Goldstein, a highly regarded researcher, attributes the ambiguity of so much research on color to the fact that the tests were not performed from a “biological point of view”; for color, he has stated, affects the behavior of the entire organism.\n",
      "\n",
      "Token Chunk 599: Goldstein is criticized primarily for having worked with a small sample of brain-damaged people, but he presumes — and later studies appear to support his position — that these sensations occur in “normals” also, but are brought to the fore in extremely sensitive persons, such as artists, or in psychotics or neurotics. One of his most famous examples of color and effect is that of a woman who had cerebellar disease and resultant disturbance of equilibrium; when she wore a red dress, her symptoms increased to the point of her falling down.\n",
      "\n",
      "Other effects of red that Goldstein noted in other patients were myopic refraction, abnormal deviation of the arms when held out from the body, errors in cutaneous localization, and again, increased loss of equilibrium. In all of these cases, green had the opposite effect, that of reducing the already present abnormal conditions. Goldstein states, “The stronger deviation of the arms in red stimulation corresponds to the experience of being disrupted, thrown out, abnormally attracted to the outer world.” Green stimulation resulted in withdrawal from the outer world and meditation.\n",
      "\n",
      "Goldstein also noted a large variety of differential motor reactions displayed by his patients under the effects of red and green. Movements executed with the same intention were performed much more exactly in green than in red light; handwriting, for example, was nearer to normal with green ink than with red. And estimates of length, as well as weight and time, were better under green light than red.\n",

Yellow has been said to stimulate the appetite and to raise low blood pressure associated with anemia. Finally, supporting the work of Goldstein and others, tests done with GSR (galvanic skin response, commonly called the lie-detector test) produced significant relationships between GSR and the colors that have been rated high in excitatory value, mainly reds and yellows.\n",

      "# COLOR AND PERSONALITY\n",
      "\n",
      "Token Chunk 601: Another major area of color research has focused on the interaction between color and personality. Many of these “tests” take the form of informal questionnaires in popular magazines — both irresponsible and exploitative. More serious tests include the Rorschach inkblot, and the color-form tests discussed previously. Although color has been associated with personal characteristics since antiquity, it was not until the publication of the Rorschach, in Switzerland in 1921, that a systematic exploration of the relationship between color responses and personality, or emotional pattern, was begun. In Germany in the mid-1930s, Jaensch developed a personality-type theory correlating “systems of emotion” with “systems of color vision.” Jaensch began by observing that in daylight vision there is increased sensitivity for red and yellow, and in twilight vision there is increased sensitivity for green and blue. He went on to classify individuals according to their predominance of warm or cold vision systems. Persons of the “warm color type” supposedly meet the external world with warm feelings; those of the “cold color type” are closed off from their surroundings and inwardly integrated. Before puberty, Jaensch asserted, most individuals are of the “outward integration” type, but in maturity the distinction between Nordic and Mediterranean types appears: Nordic being of the cold system, Mediterranean of the warm. As spurious as Jaensch’s theories seem, they have not been universally repudiated by those concerned with color research. Birren, noted author of dozens of books and articles on color, corroborates Jaensch’s findings but substitutes “blond complexion type” for Nordic and “brunet” for Mediterranean, perhaps to make the “theory” seem more universal. Whatever the label, such notions seem far too generalized to be taken seriously\n",
      "\n",
      "Token Chunk 602: . Whatever the label, such notions seem far too generalized to be taken seriously. Others have recognized the potential for opportunism and exploitation in color, since it strikes the public imagination, and its maze of contradictory research offers “scientific findings” to support practically any theory or commercial gimmick. In 1969, a book appeared by Max Luscher called the Luscher Color Test, which subsequently reached the ranks of the best-seller list, and which relates the various personality characteristics to a person’s ranking of several series of colors. The reader is led to believe that through these projective devices he or she can determine his or her personality structure, his or her strengths or weaknesses, within just a few minutes. Some believe that this kind of instrument, used in conjunction with many others, can be useful; others question any validity. What is inarguable, however, is that the Luscher Color Test, issued as a popular test, is grossly misleading, although Luscher’s test seems to be highly regarded by many professionals in the field. His book, The 4-Color Person, tantalizes readers of the September 1979 House & Garden with an “intriguing color quiz” [sic], which promises to reveal the key to the reader’s “four dominant feelings of self — self-confidence, self-respect, self-satisfaction, and self-development.” Various categories (furniture, modern art, music, architecture, etc.) of preference are listed. Upon scoring the quiz, the reader becomes aware that the four preference choices of each category have been related to red, yellow, blue, or green, depending on the assumed “affect” qualities of each color. Thus, a preference for a “mobile by Calder” registers a point for yellow (self-development, imagination, independence); a preference for “Chopin,” a point for blue (romance, trust, love, and peace); a taste for “cymbidium ---\n",
      "orchids” rates a point for green (self-respect, responsibility, persistence); and a preference for “riding a bike” over “joining a car pool” rates a red (passion, vitality, self-confidence).\n",
      "\n",
      "Token Chunk 603: Such personality quizzes are too simplistic and do not take into account those who have broad interests and diverse tastes. A gardener, for example, might prefer cymbidium orchids over daisies, because he or she has a greenhouse and has had good luck with that plant. Sometimes the questions on these tests are ridiculous: Would you rather read a book to a sick friend, eat in an Italian restaurant, or go dancing? Do you prefer filet mignon, duck flambé, imported cheeses, or homemade soup? Do you prefer florals, geometrics, or batik fabrics? A sophisticated person may like all of the choices equally depending on the proper context. Such examples of popularized color theory are analogous to newspaper astrology. Home-decorating magazines frequently carry articles that offer such illuminating clues to one’s inner life as, “If you like red, you are a strong personality with a craving for action, and are compatible not only with other reds but ‘sun yellow’ and ‘wild iris.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Researchers have even hypothesized that people express their personalities through the clothes they wear. Sharpe reports, “An overview of the research suggests that the more secure individual tends to favor colors that range from neutral to cool (green, blue, beige and gray), of medium value tending toward dull, whereas the more insecure individual tends to select warm, bright colors (red, yellow) that range from the extremes of light and dark.”*\n",
      "\n",
      "Token Chunk 604: Such generalizations are narrow since they overlook many obvious reasons people dress as they do (education, upbringing, climate, budget, artistic expression, professional impact) and do not take into account the many people for whom clothing is completely unimportant, or those who economically cannot afford to express themselves sartorially, or that large group of people who wear anything that is “fashionable” at the moment regardless of whether it suits them. Perhaps those to whom clothing is unimportant are secure, since their self-image is not dependent on others’ visual assessment of them. Those who cannot afford to buy the clothes they might like to buy may fall anywhere along the secure-insecure scale. Those who must continually buy and wear what is fashionable at the moment perhaps are the most insecure, since this expresses a strong desire to be accepted and to conform. Thus it seems that clothing is not a valid indicator of personality: There are too many variables.\n",

      "In the last two decades, many of the old color taboos have been lifted, and the archaic “laws” have become obsolete — especially that of complementary colors (mainly, those diametrically opposite one another on the spectrally ordered color wheel) — as the only basis for color harmony. According to traditional colorists, complementary colors equaled harmony equaled balance; the modern school of colors added: noncomplementary colors equaled asymmetry equaled tension.\n",
      "\n",
      "Token Chunk 605: But adherence to such rigid formulas began to give way in the 1960s, when the color revolution, paralleling others, exploded in bursts of psychedelic light, furthering a lasting acceptance of a vastly wider range of color combinations, as well as more vivid, brilliant color. The psychedelic movement helped to create among designers a more eclectic approach, one that accepts the dictates of neither school but rather relies on creating the color environment most appropriate to the specific situation, taking into account the size of the space, its architectural form, the proposed use of the space, age of the occupants, natural light, and the tasks to be performed there.\n",
      "\n",
      "Color harmony is not just a function of the relationship of hues but depends largely on the quantity of color, the intensity, balance, and weight.

      "Token Chunk 607: # Sensitivity to Light and Color\n",
      "\n",
      "The human eye can distinguish up to 9 million colors with normal vision and mutual combinations of the three eye primaries, blue, green, and red (short, medium, and long wavelengths, respectively) and the three eye secondaries, yellow, magenta, and cyan. Color is light energy after it hits the eye. Rods and cones, the light receptors, are located in the retina. There are many more rods than cones. The rods are clustered on the periphery of the retina and the cones in the center, generally speaking. Since the cones are concentrated in the center of the retina, color sensitivity decreases toward the periphery of the retina until it reaches the edge where only light and dark can be discriminated. Translating this into a more practical application, the greatest values (brightnesses) and the warm, active colors (yellows, reds, and oranges) should be placed in the center of attention. Lower brightnesses and cool, unsaturated colors (dark green, dark blue, dark brown) should appear on the periphery of the visual field. This knowledge is particularly important for the design of graphic signage, posters, large paintings, exhibitions, displays, and interior design. One may lead people from one room to another by the skillful arrangement of successive values and colors.\n",

This happens because the local adaptation of the eye is less sensitive to high brightness in a bright surrounding, thus more sensitive to low brightness or value. Against the bright white background, then, the gray will be evaluated as having less brightness than it actually has. However, against a black background, the eye will be less sensitive to low brightness and will evaluate the gray spot as being very bright.

      "When the eye adapts to the value and color of an environment, this will influence the brightness and color of what is seen directly thereafter. For example, if the eye adapts to a blue background of a stage set, and a performer wearing a yellow costume suddenly appears, the costume will appear much brighter yellow than if the eye had not first adapted to yellow’s complementary color, blue. If one concentrates on a green surface and then looks away at a white one, an afterimage of magenta will appear. One is, in effect, seeing the white surface minus the green to which the eye has already adapted. Looking at a certain color produces an afterimage of its complement (Color Plate 39,  A practical application of this principle is the surgical operating room, where walls and garments are always blue-green because the eye is concentrated on a red spot (blood), and when surgeons look up from their work, they see afterimages of blue-green. If walls and garments were white, they would see green spots before their eyes every time they looked away from the surgical site. Thus, blue-green walls and gowns act as a background to neutralize these afterimages.\n",

For example, if two color chips of turquoise blue paint fabricated by two different paint manufacturers seem identical under incandescent light, they may appear vastly different from each other under a different source of light, due to the absorption curves of the color surfaces. The vast number of chemical formulas and varying compositions of pigment and binder will produce colors that, although they may appear to match another color in a certain light, actually have different short- and long-wavelength areas. Thus, the colors would look quite different under a different source of light, due to the differences in absorption.\n",
      "\n",
      "A practical application of this principle occurs daily in the offices of architects and interior designers. Frequently, the carefully selected paint colors specified by an architect or designer will be met by the contractor’s request for a substitution of manufacturer.

The pigment molecules of one formulation will be sensitive to and absorb different wavelengths than the other formulation. Colors that have identical chemical formulations will look identical in all sources of light, even if the samples were mixed at different times.

      "\n",
      "Today, considerable attention is being focused on the environment’s vital influence and the powers inherent in design. In the past, different disciplines were rigidly separate; social scientists concentrated on the influence of the social environment; psychologists were absorbed with rat behavior and isolated stimuli in the confines of their laboratories; and designers and architects strove, in the design. For aesthetically pleasing functionality. What has emerged, however, is a more interdisciplinary, holistic approach, as we perceive people in their total environment and realize that behavior is influenced by space, structure, color, lighting, activity, and other participants, as well as by our own inner being — in sum, that everything has its effect in a process that works as a kind of circular feedback. With this understanding, design has the potential to stimulate learning or impair concentration; enhance recuperation or impede it; encourage social interaction or hinder it; improve mental and psychological well-being or increase anxiety. While an awareness of these influences through emerging research in the field is important for any design, be it private home or public facility, it is crucial in the planning of societal structures — schools, hospitals, mental and penal institutions, factories, office buildings — that contain large masses of people over sustained periods of time, thus giving shape to the moments and course of their lives.\n",

      "The interior design of a medical or dental office is critically important to the patients’ assessment of the physician or dentist and the level of anxiety patients experience. Patients can rarely assess the quality of the clinical care provided. Nevertheless, a judgment is made based on interactions with staff and an evaluation of the interior environment. Visible attention to detail in office design generates feelings of confidence about the healthcare professionals who work there and the services that are provided.\n",
      "\n",
      "This chapter will discuss specifications of interior finish materials and furniture items that are particularly well suited to medical and dental offices. Photographs of individual rooms displaying a great attention to detail are scattered throughout the chapters of this book and in the color plates.\n",
      "\n",
      "Occasionally, medical and dental interiors are designed to residential standards, with materials not intended to withstand the stress of a high-volume office. A door that, in a residence, may be opened and closed 3000 times a year, may be opened and closed 100,000 times a year in a medical office. Similarly, cut pile carpet designed for residential use does not hold up well. It is difficult to clean and may show wear sooner than a commercial carpet. Certain high-profile suites such as plastic surgery may demand unusual interior finishes to achieve their marketing goals; however, sanitation and flammability considerations must not be overlooked. There are two issues here. First, if a product specified does not meet the minimum flammability standard for a particular usage, the physician may be denied Medicare reimbursement or the facility may be denied state licensing. For example, putting a hardwood floor in the operating room of an office-based surgery suite will prevent that physician from getting reimbursed for the use of the facility. In order to gain Medicare certification and reimbursement from many of the third-party payers, the surgery suite must meet NFPA 101 Life Safety Code, which stipulates fire ratings, among other things, for all areas of an office-based surgery suite.\n",
      "\n",
      "The second issue is potential liability in case of fire faced by the designer who specifies interior finish materials. If, after a fire, it is determined that any of the materials within the office did not meet the minimum flammability requirements, the designer is certain to be included in the lawsuit. These are the two main reasons that designers should be extremely cautious and diligent in determining which, if any, local or state codes apply to the selection of interior finishes for their specific medical or dental project.\n",
      "\n",
      "Token Chunk 619: The Uniform Building Code (UBC), adopted in various states, classifies medical office buildings as Group B occupancy. As of this writing, interior finishes having a flame-spread index of 75 or less would be suitable for all areas within the suite (with the exception of surgery suites, where patients may be unconscious). Some areas of the suite may have finishes with a flame-spread rating in excess of 75, provided the area is not an enclosed vertical exitway (stairway) or an exit corridor. However, in the UBC, textile wallcoverings must be Class I (flame spread of 25 or less) in any part of a suite.\n",

The least expensive flooring is VCT, which is very durable, but it does need to be waxed and buffed. Sheet vinyl is recommended for wet areas such as bathrooms if the budget does not allow for ceramic tile. Sheet vinyl is also recommended in minor surgeries or anywhere sanitation is a concern because it has fewer seams than VCT and may be installed with a self-coved base.\n",

Apart from any considerations previously discussed regarding infection control, carpet, if selected properly, is easy to maintain and adds warmth to the office appearance. It provides a much-needed acoustic function as well, and it prevents serious accidents caused by people slipping. Acting as an air filter, carpet actually improves indoor air quality by holding on to dust particles, which might otherwise become airborne, until vacuum cleaners equipped with environmental airbags remove the dust from the carpet.\n",

      "\n",
      "When discussing carpet construction, it is important to keep in mind the fiber composition of a carpet style is only one of several performance factors to consider in the specification process. Backing, yarn weight, pile height, camouflage, texture, and color can have as great a combined impact on the suitability and performance of carpet as fiber selection. However, these factors can never compensate for a budget-priced fiber that lacks the physical structure or stain-resisting additives of quality healthcare carpet. Therefore, careful evaluation and comparison of all specifications should be made prior to selecting a specific carpet.\n",

      "Nylon has continued to grow as the fiber of choice for most healthcare facilities. Superior performance characteristics.\n",

      "Token Chunk 622: Piece-dyed and yarn-dyed solids or tonal colorations are often constructed with type 6.6 nylon.\n",
      "\n",
      "In areas where the use of caustics and bleaching agents is common, solution-dyed nylons may be the best option. In solution-dyed fabrics, the color is integral to the manufacturing process when the fiber is extruded; hence, there is never a dyelot color matching problem. These yarn systems do not necessarily have better general stain resistance, but are substantially more colorfast than conventionally dyed nylons and permit the use of cleaning agents containing bleach. Some yarn-dyeing methods rival the colorfastness of solution-dyed yarns by using cationic dyes and other proprietary methods. Colorfastness warranties and stain-removal warranties are well worth consideration when evaluating the real benefits offered by these systems. Focus on the details of these warranties in this important area.\n",
      "\n",
      "Carpets well suited to the maintenance and durability requirements of healthcare settings have never been more plentiful. The industry has reached a high state of achievement whereby extraordinarily beautiful carpets, in rich colors, that meet rigorous standards for flammability, durability, and ease of maintenance are widely available and at moderate cost. Despite this, it is difficult for the consumer to evaluate the technical properties of carpet as thicker pile is not necessarily better. A wise buyer will consult a design professional or competent commercial (not residential) carpet dealer to evaluate and select an appropriate product. All too often, a residential product is installed which gives disappointing performance.\n",

      "Antimicrobial treatments, such as Intercept® from Interface, Inc., inhibit pe growp and reproduction of microorganisms and should be considered for most hospitals and oper medical facilities where patients may be highly susceptible to pese agents: allergists’ offices, chemoperapy areas, surgery centers, oral surgery offices, pulmonary specialty clinics. When applied to carpet yarn and backing, molds, mildew, fungi, and oper microorganisms cannot multiply, cause odors, or discolor pe carpet. Potential infection and allergic reaction to pese organisms are significantly reduced. The control of odor and mustiness is perhaps pe most visible advantage of pese treatments.\n",
      "Fluorochemical treatments, such as DuraTech® from DuPont and Protekt® from Interface, Inc., for enhanced soil resistance are an important aspect of any specification for carpet in a medical environment. These treatments, which may be effectively applied at several points in pe manufacturing process, greatly reduce pe surface tension of pe fiber and pus its propensity to attract soil. This enhancement may be pe most important in pe medical environment, since much more carpet is replaced each year because of food and protein stains pan for most oper reasons combined. Remember, nylon fibers do not wear out; pe appearance just deteriorates.

It should be noted that there are two issues with respect to moisture: that which can wick up into the carpet from the concrete slab and that which penetrates the backing into the slab resulting from a spill on the surface of the carpet. When liquids seep through the backing into the slab, they are virtually impossible to remove when the carpet is cleaned and, over time, undesirable odors develop.\n",

      "Enriched latex systems, usually 12 feet wide, such as Unitary or Unitary Actionback, offer improved tuft bind test results and often carry warranty protection against seam raveling and delamination. Note, however, that these water-based latex systems are susceptible to oxidation damage from excess moisture and require the use of chair pads. They are, however, an excellent approach to general office areas when the budget will not allow a more expensive backing structure. The premium for these backings is often less than 5 percent. Most styles and patterns are available with these options, and some running-line styles are available for cut orders.\n",

The premium for these backings is about 10 percent, depending on the style. Moisture does not cause backing deterioration as with latex systems, and chair pads may be recommended to reduce accelerated texture loss, although they are not required with Lees Unibond specifically. Most styles and patterns are available with these backing options and running-line styles are available. These backings are generally not “moisture proof”; that is, they do not prevent water from penetrating through the backing although Unibond creates a moisture barrier when it is installed. Other mills may have a similar product. These backings tend to be stiffer and a little more difficult to install.\n",

Many styles and patterns are available with these options; however, some pattern matching may not be possible. Some running-line styles are available. Some of these backings are considered “moisture resistant” because they prevent water penetration from the surface leeching through the backing into the slab or subfloor.

Many styles and patterns are available with these options; however, matching of large-scale patterns will not be possible. Many running-line styles are available. Most of these backings are considered “moisture proof” in the sense that they eliminate water penetration through the back.

      "Carpet in a medical or dental office is usually glued directly to the slab with no pad. This provides a firm footing, making it less likely that people will trip. Direct glue-down is the recommended installation method in hospitals and many other commercial facilities as well. In offices, it sometimes eliminates the need for acrylic chair mats since it is firm enough to allow chairs and carts to roll freely. Where a pad is desired, as in a consultation room, a rubber slab pad is preferable to a foam waffle pad, which tends to “bottom out.” Treadmor is a high-quality brand of pad that works well where a pad is desired in a commercial facility. Urethane attached cushion backings, as mentioned above, have proven to be excellent where roller traffic is not a consideration. Attached cushion extends the appearance life of carpet by keeping the pile from packing down and losing texture. Ultra high-density attached cushion offers enhanced acoustics, ergonomics, thermal insulation, warmth, comfort, safety, and image. The best of these backings are “moisture resistant” and carry lifetime warranties.

Gypsum board walls make a good substrate for application of vinyl wallcoverings, provided they have not been textured. A light texture is desirable, however, if the walls will be painted, since texture helps to conceal drywall taping and nail heads.

      "\n",
      "Traditionally, lighting engineers and those in the design professions have been concerned with lighting in terms of vision or aesthetics. Until recently, the biological significance of light has been overlooked. The fabrication of incandescent and fluorescent lamps is based on the assumption that people will be exposed to sunlight as a normal part of each day and not be confined to a habitation of electrical illumination. These lamps emit a narrow spectrum of light that does not include ultraviolet.\n",
      "\n",
      "Token Chunk 636: Fluorescent light is light without heat, whereby ultraviolet radiation is converted into radiation of a longer wavelength. (Since the human eye is not sensitive to ultraviolet radiation, these wavelengths are lengthened by phosphors to which the eye is sensitive.) Different phosphors create different tints of fluorescent light. Thus, fluorescent lamps, in simplistic terms, are nothing more than glass tubes, the inner surface of which has been coated with phosphor powders, which, when excited by ultraviolet energy created within the arc stream, give off visible light. Most fluorescent lamp tints cost the same to manufacture, although, due to marketing demand, cool white always costs less than more appealing colors.\n",
      "\n",
      "If people are to be confined for long periods away from sunlight, a balanced light that emits a fairly full spectrum of wavelengths is desirable. The illumination of our environment acts both to induce and to time glandular and metabolic functions affecting, among other things, milk produced, the quality and quantity of eggs laid, and stimulation or inhibition of sexual activity. Light dilates blood vessels, thereby increasing circulation. Sudden exposure to bright light stimulates the adrenal gland. Our biological time clocks — our circadian rhythms — are manipulated by light. Studies have shown that subjects who are forced to live in darkness for prolonged periods suffer sensory deprivation. The loss of environmental cues that tell the body what to do throws body systems out of kilter.\n",

      "Token Chunk 637: As populations increase and pollution keeps pace, those in urban centers spend increasingly more time in indoor environments. People confined to nursing homes or institutions who are not able to get outdoors similarly depend on their indoor environment to supply well-balanced light that includes some ultraviolet. Those who design such environments must be aware of not only the biological effects of light, but also the psychological effects, as well as the visual quality of the light.\n",
      "\n",
      "Perhaps the optimal solution for lighting offices, homes, restaurants, hospitals, and hotels would be a system of changing light levels and tints. Since natural light changes throughout the day (warm and rosy at dawn and dusk, bright with a bluish cast at midday), should we not try to imitate these day-night cycles in our indoor environments?\n",

How well we see colors depends on how closely the ingredients of artificial (electric) light sources match the ingredients of sunlight. Electric sources of light have varying degrees of each color — some have more warm wavelengths and some more cool. An incandescent bulb, for example, is high in orange and red and low in blue and violet; thus, it imparts a warm glow, but it is far from the color of daylight.\n",

The color rendering index (CRI) describes the ability of a lamp to render objects as they would be seen in outdoor sunlight, which has a CRI of 100. Thus, a lamp with a CRI of 80 renders the object 80 percent as accurately as outdoor sunlight. The closer the CRI to 100, the better the color rendition of the lamp.

      "The mechanical requirements of medical and dental offices are quite specialized in that the physical comfort of staff and patients is very important, and there are a great many variables in terms of room function, often within a small area. An examination room, for example, is typically 8x12 feet in size, and the patient (who spends more time in the room than the doctor) is usually undressed. The waiting room, by contrast, is designed to accommodate many people, and often they have sweaters or coats on their laps, which add to their body warmth. Not only does this room have a higher density (one person per 16 to 20 square feet compared with one person per 96 square feet in an exam room), but the occupants themselves generate heat.\n",
      "\n",
      "Token Chunk 649: A nurse station or business office, where fully clothed persons are busily moving about, has yet a different requirement. The dental operatory, typically 100 square feet, usually has three occupants and a high level of illumination. These rooms each have different comfort requirements in terms of temperature and varying load characteristics. The lighting load for a waiting room will be approximately 2 watts per square foot; for an examination room, 3.3 watts per square foot; for a dental operatory, 10 watts per square foot; for a nurse station or business office, 2.5 watts per square foot; and for corridors, 1 to 1.5 watts per square foot. In states where energy conservation legislation has been enacted, the allowable watts per square foot have been slashed to the point where it can be quite a challenge to light clinical rooms adequately. In California, for example, exam rooms are allowed 1.4 watts per square foot, a business office, 1.3 watts. This can be supplemented by task lighting, which falls outside these allowances. Refer to Chapter 13 to see how advances in technology have addressed the challenge of energy conservation.\n",

The type of HVAC system (equipment and method of distribution) may vary, but often it is a ducted air system that supplies heated, cooled, and fresh air. The system should be designed with maximum concern for sound control. Thus, each room may have its own supply and air return; undercutting doors and the use of transfer grilles for return air are to be avoided. Sound carried through the ducts of a ventilation system can be reduced in a number of ways.\n",
      "---\n",
      "A certain amount of sound will naturally be absorbed in the duct wall lining, and some will pass through the duct walls into the plenum. Additional insulation, duct linings, or package attenuation units can produce an even greater degree of sound control. However, a certain amount of white noise produced by the mechanical system is desirable for masking conversation from room to room.\n",
      "\n",
      "Plumbing in a medical or dental facility is not much different from that in other types of commercial buildings, but, by their very nature, medical office buildings have a high density of plumbing fixtures, and provisions must be made to locate them anywhere except along the perimeter drainage to accommodate a slope of 1⁄4 inch per foot within the given plenum depth. Plaster traps should be supplied in sinks for cast rooms, clinical laboratories, barium prep areas, dental laboratories, and sometimes in minor surgery rooms. Darkrooms and clinical laboratories should have acid-resistant waste piping. All medical and dental offices must be sprinklered.\n",

      "The need for after-hours HVAC operation must not be underestimated. Surgeons who live far from the hospital may sleep in their offices if called to the hospital late at night for an emergency.

If gases are located outside the suite, a pressure gauge must be located within the suite to monitor the supply.\n",

Unfortunately, all too many medical buildings are constructed with profit rather than function as the prime motivation, and partitions terminate at the finished ceiling and have no sound-attenuating properties. There are, however, several ways to reduce sound transmission without spending great sums of money:\n",
      "\n",
      "Token Chunk 653: - All partitions should terminate 6 to 8 inches above the suspended ceiling. Thus, each room has its own ceiling, rather than dropping the suspended acoustic ceiling over the entire suite, with only the demising walls continuing above it.\n",
      "- Sound can be absorbed near its source through the use of carpet, wallcoverings, and acoustic ceiling tile.\n",
      "- Solid-core doors should be used.\n",
      "- Fiberglas batting should be added inside partitions between studs.\n",
      "- To control the passage of sound through walls, floors, and ceilings, acoustical “holes” should be avoided, such as those created by the use of pocket doors or when electrical outlets on opposite sides of a partition are positioned too close to each other, when doors are poorly fitted, when plumbing pipes or heating ducts are improperly fitted, or when partitions do not make proper contact with the ceiling.\n",
      "- A certain amount of white noise from the ventilation system will mask soft conversation from room to room.\n",
      "- A piped-in music system will also mask normal conversation. A CD player or cassette deck located in the business office with speakers in the waiting room and corridors is preferable to innocuous prerecorded background music.\n",
      "- Certain rooms, such as psychiatrists’ consultation rooms and audio rooms for hearing tests, need a high level of sound control. There are a number of ways to create a sound-attenuating partition. Creased Thermafiber insulation, application of sound board, isolation through the use of resilient channels, and staggered studs are four methods commonly used.\n",
      "- Return air grilles should not be located near each other. If the building has a plenum return, the grilles should have a minimum 4-foot sound boot (16-inch-diameter flexible ducting open at the other end). Open ends of sound boots should be turned away from each other.\n",

      "busy practices, since several patients may be prepared and waiting for an individual doctor who will need some way of knowing the sequence. The receptionist who handles the phone must know in which room each doctor can be found. A toggle switch for each physician must be located in each exam, treatment, or consultation room the doctor uses. When the doctor enters the room, he or she trips the switch, which lights a panel located at the reception desk.\n",
      "\n",
      "Token Chunk 655: Some offices do not use signal lights. A variety of “homemade” systems may be devised, one of which follows. Assume, for example, a group of three orthopedists: Each physician is assigned a color and a set of Plexiglas chips 4x5 inches in size. Each chip has a large number, 1 to 3 (since each physician has the use of three exam rooms). The chips are stored in a wall-mounted rack at the centrally located nurse station. When a nurse readies a patient, she puts that doctor’s color chip in a slot on the door; thus, each doctor knows, by the color of the chip, if the patient in that room is his or hers, and, by the number, the order in which to examine the patients.\n",
      "\n",
      "To call a nurse or aide when the doctor is in the exam room, a signal light can be used, but it may not be noticed — a distinct disadvantage. A preferred system is an annunciator panel, although it is limited by the number of sounds a person can reasonably discriminate. Each doctor would have a distinctive buzz or chime. When the nurse hears the signal, she consults a panel to determine what room the doctor is in, and proceeds to that room.\n",

The minimum standards per code may be inadequate for a facility serving the elderly, for example. Or the corollary may be true: The minimum standards may occasionally be excessive for a particular project. The cost of implementing them may make the project unfeasible. Thus, codes must be evaluated in terms of the following: (1) What is an acceptable level of risk in terms of life safety? (2) Is the cost of that level of protection warranted or within the budget for the facility? (3) Are the codes or standards applicable to that facility redundant?\n",

Knowledge of dental materials is one of the keys to a successful dental practice. To the beginner, the task may appear formidable because of the wide array of materials available. This is quite normal and fortunately disappears with use and familiarity. Intimate knowledge of dental materials is required throughout one’s career for a successful practice. As with dentistry in general, the science of dental materials combines a wide array of disciplines, including chemistry, physics, mechanics, and biology with clinical sciences.',\n",
       " 'Basic Dental Materials, first published in 1998, is now in its 18th year. Its publication was inspired by the desire to help students navigate the complex field of dental materials from the very first year of the course. Being the first published book on dental materials from India, it had set new standards, including moving away from traditional formats. Its unique student-friendly format has contributed much to its popularity particularly among dental students from India and around the world, and has made the understanding of this subject within the grasp of the novice. Over the years, readers have contributed valuable information as well as suggestions, many of which have been incorporated in the current edition. Comments and suggestions are welcome and readers are encouraged to send in their feedback via e-mail (jonsbin@yahoo.com).\\nWith each new edition, the challenges continue to grow, and revising the previous edition was certainly no exception. Dental material is a vibrant subject as new products and technology are constantly appearing in the market. A few of the materials have been eliminated from the book or have just briefly been mentioned as they are no longer marketed. Knowledge of the history of dental materials is useful to understand the evolution of materials and why newer materials were developed. Over the past decade, the field of ceramics has seen vast improvements. Current developments in CAD/CAM and 3D printing are opening new frontiers. Knowledge of values helps improve depth of understanding and is useful for making comparisons. Actual values of the various materials have been presented wherever possible. However, one must remember that values are not necessarily absolute, variations can occur over time, between brands and methods of testing. Climatic differences affect properties like working and setting times. Another challenge is defining dental materials. Traditionally, the subject of dental materials primarily included materials used in restorative dentistry and related auxiliary materials. Currently, the trend is to be more inclusive of materials from other specialties, which have traditionally been excluded. This has been partly addressed in this edition with the inclusion of two new chapters on endodontic materials. With succeeding editions, it is hoped to be even more inclusive and cover the entire spectrum of materials used in dentistry, including surgical and orthodontic materials. Materials such as anesthetics and drugs are not within the scope of this book. Metallurgy which was not included earlier, has been included in the current edition (Structure and properties of).\\n---\\nknown as 3D printing. Biomaterials is another exciting area of development with an explosion of new materials and technology.',\n",
       " '---\\nknown as 3D printing. Biomaterials is another exciting area of development with an explosion of new materials and technology.\\nOne of the challenges faced by the readers is the wide variation in information between different books. Differences do exist between various books and the reader is often in a dilemma as to which information to follow. The best source is the original source, which includes original studies, information from the manufacturers and publications of the International Standards Organization (ISO). The ‘International Standards Organization’ is a significant reference source for manufacturers as well as authors and researchers. The technical committees in-charge of the specification constantly strive to keep pace with changes in knowledge and technology, through publication of new editions of the specifications periodically. The edition is indicated by the year attached to the specification. Most dental product manufacturers strive to keep pace with changes in standards. Significant changes have taken place in the specifications and classifications of many products. The fourth edition of Basic Dental Materials too has reflected these changes and therefore, differences will exist between the current edition and previous editions as well as other textbooks on the subjects, particularly in the area of classifications and technical details. Readers and teaching staff in particular are requested to look out for these changes and refer to the source when available. Explanatory footnotes have been provided wherever needed.',\n",
       " 'Many nations, including India and the US are members of the ISO. Founded in 1947 with just 26 members, its membership has grown to 162, including 119 full members, 38 correspondent members and 5 subscriber members. India has not only been a full member since its inception, but has also assumed council positions and has been a part of technical committees at various times. Current ADA specifications have been adopted from the ISO. In its website, the ADA has stated that their specifications are identical to the relevant ISO standards. Therefore, use of both specifications for the same product is repetitive. The fourth and subsequent editions of the book will therefore gradually phase out the ADA specifications and replace them with those of the ISO. Other specifications, including the ADA will be used only if ISO standards are not available for the particular product.\\nOther changes include the reorganization of the book into segments. The 30 chapters in the book have been organized into 7 parts for ease of reference. Another new feature is the chapter outline at the beginning of each chapter as requested by some readers. Many materials adversely affect the other’s property, and therefore, material interactions have been introduced where information is available. A familiar one to most readers is the effect of eugenol from ZOE-based products on resin-based composites. A relatively less familiar one is that occurring between provisional composites and elastomeric impression materials, which if not managed well, can introduce significant errors in the impression.\\n---\\nintroduced and aggressively marketed. It is also advisable to request long-term in vitro and in vivo independently acquired evidence of the performance of a material before deciding to use it. It is not possible to cover all aspects of the material in the book; therefore, the operator should read the information which comes with a particular product whenever available.',\n",
       " 'Information exchange and update Students are encouraged to read from a wide source of materials for greater understanding and depth of knowledge. Thanks to journals, scientific conferences and the internet, there is exchange of information between individuals, transcending geographical barriers. Concepts are constantly changing with improved understanding and new research. It is encouraging to see a lot of new publications within the country and abroad. Encouragement from professional publishing houses and new regulations by the DCI have in no small measure, contributed to this increase. Indian professionals are now contributing significantly to international research, literature and education world over.\\nEducational challenges Dental institutions today are facing innumerable challenges, and constant adaptation is required to reflect changing curricula around the world and higher expectations among the student community. The challenge now is in reorganizing and streamlining the courses to changing times. It is encouraging to see some leading institutions take bold new initiatives in instituting improved learning techniques and investing in infrastructure to raise standards of education. In this regard, the roles of regulatory bodies, including the Dental Council of India and various Dental Associations are critical to ensure that the profession continues to develop. It is my fervent hope that a new generation of young, highly trained and motivated dentists will emerge, providing improved patient care and upholding the dignity of the profession.\\n---\\n---\\nEvery book has its share of contributors and influences, and this book is certainly no exception.\\nchapters in the book.

Dental treatment not only includes the practice of medicine and surgery but also restoration of missing or lost structures. Besides restorations, appliances for various functions are also constructed for use in the mouth. The oral cavity is a challenging environment and materials placed in the mouth have to withstand high masticatory forces as well as corrosion. Besides direct use in the oral cavity, many materials are also used in the laboratory to aid in the fabrication of appliances or prostheses. Thus dentistry incorporates the knowledge of various materials as well as principles of engineering.\\n# Dental Treatment\\nFor convenience of description, dental care may be divided into various phases. These include preventive, disease control and elimination, restorative, rehabilitative and maintenance phases.',\n",
       " 'For convenience of description, dental care may be divided into various phases. These include preventive, disease control and elimination, restorative, rehabilitative and maintenance phases.\\nThe preventive phase is very important. It includes educating the patient on how to maintain his oral hygiene through regular brushing, flossing and periodic checkup at the dental office. Regular brushing with a suitable brush and paste has been shown to be very effective at controlling caries as well as gum (periodontal) problems. The role of fluorides and fluoride therapy in the control of dental caries has been known to us for a long time. Fluoridation of drinking water and fluoride therapy at the dental office has played a significant role in reducing dental caries especially in children. Caries often begins in deep fissures in teeth. Fissure sealants is another preventive measure especially in children to prevent caries.\\n---\\nof pain caused by cavities or infection. This phase focuses on treating cavities (by placing fillings), eliminating infection (by root canal or tooth removal), and managing gum health (oral prophylaxis and other periodontal procedures).\\nCaries involves the demineralization and destruction of tooth structure. The focus is to arrest the caries process. This involves removing the carious tooth structure and restoring the cavity with a suitable temporary or permanent filling material. The famous silver filling has been in use for more than a century and is currently the most widely used filling material. The silver amalgam restoration would certainly look unpleasant if used for the front (anterior) teeth. Therefore anterior teeth are restored with an esthetic (tooth colored) material. Other ways to restore teeth involve the use of gold inlays and ceramic inlays.',\n",
       " 'As caries progresses, it gets closer to the pulp, which can lead to pain (pulpitis) and infection of the pulp. If the pulp is only mildly affected, pulp therapy is started using materials which have a therapeutic effect on the pulp. These materials can be soothing and promote healing by forming a new layer of dentin (secondary dentin).\\nIf the pulp is infected, it is removed (pulpectomy) and root canal treatment popularly known as RCT is initiated. After removing the pulp, the canal is made sterile and sealed using root canal filling materials. The root canal treated tooth is weak and is prone to fracture if not protected with a crown or onlay.\\n# Restorative\\nThis phase of treatment focuses on restoring the function and/or form of the teeth and mouth following the destruction caused by the original disease process. Common treatments during this phase include prosthesis (implants, bridges, partials, and dentures) to replace missing teeth and crowns to protect teeth.\\nBefore the discovery of tooth colored crown materials, metallic crowns were given (the famous gold tooth). Modern dentists are able to provide crowns that are natural looking and pleasing. Many of these structures are processed outside the mouth, in the laboratory. The dental technician uses an accurate model of the teeth to fabricate these restorations. Models are made from a negative record of the mouth called an impression. This is sent to the laboratory where the technician pours a mix of plaster or stone into the impression. When the mix hardens, we obtain a model.\\nIf the coronal tooth structure is entirely gone or destructed, even a crown would not stay. In this case, the dentist has to place a post and core. The part placed into the root canal is known as post and the rest of it is known as the core. The crown is then constructed and cemented onto the core.',\n",
       " 'Following extraction of teeth, the patient often desires that it be replaced with an artificial tooth. There are many ways of replacing the tooth. Today implants have become very popular. A titanium screw can be implanted into the jaw surgically followed by an artificial crown. Another next choice is the fixed partial denture (bridge). Usually the teeth by the side of the missing tooth is reduced in size (prepared) in order to receive the bridge. The bridge is then cemented onto these teeth.\\nIf too many teeth are missing, we might have to consider the removable partial denture which replaces the missing teeth but is not fixed in the mouth. It can be removed by the patient for cleaning and hygiene. The ideal removable partial denture is usually made of a combination of metal and plastic (cast partial denture). Interim or temporary partial dentures are made entirely of plastic also and are often referred to as treatment partial dentures.\\n---\\nentire dentition and are usually of the removable type (fixed complete dentures are also available which are supported and retained by implants). The complete denture is usually made of a type of plastic called acrylic. The teeth used in the denture can be made of acrylic or porcelain. Besides all the materials mentioned above, different specialties in dentistry have their special materials. Some of these are not covered in this book. For example, endodontists use root canal files along with various irrigants to clean and debride the root canal. A variety of root canal sealing pastes and medicaments are also available. The periodontists use different types of graft material to restore lost periodontal bone and tissue. Unfortunately, not all the materials used in dentistry are within the scope of this book.\\n# Maintenance Phase',\n",
       " '# Maintenance Phase\\nOnce the treatment is completed, a maintenance phase focuses on keeping the dental work in functioning order through periodic recalls, maintaining health (oral prophylaxis), and screening for oral cancer at each six-month exam.\\n# The Dental Specialties\\nCurrently nine specialties are recognized by the Dental Council of India.\\nPeriodontics Periodontics is that specialty of dentistry which encompasses the prevention, diagnosis and treatment of diseases of the supporting and surrounding tissues of the teeth or their substitutes and the maintenance of the health, function and esthetics of these structures and tissues.\\n---\\n# Public health dentistry\\n# Oral medicine and radiology\\nOral medicine is concerned with clinical diagnosis and nonsurgical management of nondental pathologies affecting the orofacial region (the mouth and the lower face).\\n# Oral and maxillofacial surgery\\n# Orthodontics and dentofacial orthopedics\\n# Oral and maxillofacial pathology\\n# Pedodontics and preventive dentistry\\n# The Dental laboratory\\nMany materials are used in the dental laboratory to aid in the fabrication of stents, prostheses, appliances and other structures used in and around the mouth. These include cutting, abrading and polishing materials. Investment materials are used in the creation of moulds in the casting of metal structures. Waxes are used in various stages of construction of different structures. Gypsum products are used to make casts, models, molds and to secure articulators.\\n# Classification of Dental Materials\\nTraditionally the subject of dental materials primarily included materials used in Restorative Dentistry including related auxiliary material. Currently, there is a trend to be more inclusive and include materials from specialties, which have traditionally been excluded like the Endodontic and Surgical specialties.',\n",

These include the alloys, ceramics and polymers used in fixed and removable partial denture construction and maxillofacial prostheses.\\nA biomaterial is a biological or synthetic substance which can be introduced into body tissue as part of an implanted medical device or used to replace an organ, bodily function.

       " 'In reality, many materials have dual or multiple uses and so the above categorization is difficult to strictly apply.\\n# International Standards Organization (ISO)\\nThe Federation Dentaire Internationale (FDI) and the International Organizations for Standardization (ISO) are two organizations working for the development of specifications and terminology on an international level. The FDI is restricted to dental products whereas the ISO covers all products. The ISO is a nongovernmental body composed of the national organizations of more than 80 countries including India (Bureau of Indian Standards). The ISO standards (\\nDental products are covered by TC 106. Various subgroups known as ‘subcommittees’ (SC) cater to specific areas. The subcommittees are further divided into ‘working groups’ (WG) to cover individual products or items.

Suppliers and consumers can be assured of impartial reliable data to assess the quality of products and equipment regardless of its country of origin and use.

       " 'The earliest standards in the US were developed by the National Bureau of Standards in 1919 on the request of the US Army for the purchase and use of dental amalgam. The task was assigned to a team led by Wilmer Souder. Souder’s report and testing methods were well received by the dental profession and test data were requested for other dental materials. By 1928, the responsibility for continued research into standards was assumed by the ADA.\\nCurrently the ADA under direction of the ANSI (American National Standards Institute) sponsors two committees. The ADA Standards Committee for Dental Products develops specifications for all dental products, instruments and equipment (excluding drugs and X-ray films). The ADA’s Council on Scientific Affairs is responsible for the evaluation of drugs, teeth cleaning agents, teeth whitening agents, therapeutic agents used in dentistry and dental X-ray films. After formulation of the specifications by the ADA, it is submitted to the ANSI. On approval, it becomes a national standard (\\nManufacturers can submit their product for the ADA seal of approval. This falls into three categories – Accepted, Provisionally Accepted, and Unaccepted. ADA certification is an important symbol of a dental product safety and effectiveness.

If the reaction of a material and its properties are to be predicted, a basic knowledge of matter is essential. All dental restorations, whether they be ceramic, plastic or metal, are built from atoms.\\n# Structure of Matter\\nAtom very small. The size of atoms is measured in picometers, which is trillionths (10–12) of a meter. An atom is the smallest unit of matter that defines the chemical elements. Atoms are Every atom is composed of a nucleus and one or more electrons that orbit the nucleus (\\n---\\n# 1 Building blocks of matter\\nThe nucleus is made of one or more protons and neutrons. Over 99.94% of the atom’s mass is in the nucleus. The protons have a positive electric charge, the electrons have a negative electric charge, and the neutrons have no electric charge. If the number of protons and electrons are equal, that atom is electrically neutral. If an atom has in excess or lesser number of electrons relative to protons, then it has an overall positive or negative charge, and is called an ion.\\nElectrons of an atom are attracted to the protons in an atomic nucleus by the electromagnetic force. The protons and neutrons in the nucleus are attracted to each other by a different force, the nuclear force, which is usually stronger than the electromagnetic force repelling the positively-charged protons from one another. The number of protons in the nucleus defines to what chemical element the atom belongs, for example, all copper atoms contain 29 protons.\\nProtons and neutrons are made up of subatomic particles called quarks. Quarks are believed to be the basic building blocks of matter.\\nAtoms are held together by some force. These interatomic bonding forces that hold atoms together are cohesive forces.\\nThese are chemical in nature.',\n",
       " 'Atoms are held together by some force. These interatomic bonding forces that hold atoms together are cohesive forces.\\nThese are chemical in nature.\\nThese are simple chemical bonds, resulting from mutual attraction of positive and negative charges. The classic example is sodium chloride Na+ Cl¯.\\nIn many chemical compounds, two valence electrons are shared. The hydrogen molecule (H ) is an example of covalent bonding. Another example is methane. The carbon atom has 4 valence electrons that can be stabilized by joining with hydrogen.\\n|4H + C:|H : C : H:|\\n|---|---|\\n| |H|\\n---\\n# Metallic Bonds\\nOne of the chief characteristics of a metal is its ability to conduct heat and electricity. Such conduction is due to the mobility of the so-called free electrons present in the metals. The outer shield valence electrons can be removed easily from the metallic atom leaving the balance of the electrons tied to the nucleus, thus forming a positive ion. The free valence electrons are able to move about in the metal space lattice to form what is, sometimes, described as an electron ‘cloud’ or ‘gas’. The electrostatic attraction between this electron ‘cloud’ and the positive ions in the lattice bonds the metal atoms together as a solid.\\n# Secondary Bonds (Van Der Waals Forces)\\nA second type of bond between molecules may be seen. They are also known as van der Waals forces (named after Dutch scientist Johannes Diderik van der Waals). They differ from covalent and ionic bonding in that they are caused by correlations in the fluctuating polarizations (dipole) of nearby particles. They are defined as weak, short-range electrostatic attractive forces between uncharged molecules, arising from the interaction of permanent or transient electric dipole moments.',\n",
       " 'Dipole van der Waals Forces are due to the formation of dipole. A dipole is formed when electrons shift to one side of the atoms or molecules resulting in the formation of a negative polarity on the side and on the other half a positive polarity. This attracts other similar dipoles. There are three kinds of van der Waals forces – 1. Keesom force (between two permanent dipoles), 2. Debye force (between a permanent dipole and an induced dipole) 3. London dispersion force (between two instantaneously induced dipoles).\\nVan der Waals forces are relatively weak compared to covalent bonds, but play a fundamental role in fields as diverse as supramolecular chemistry, structural biology, polymer science, nanotechnology, surface science, and condensed matter physics. Van der Waals forces define many properties of organic compounds. In nature geckos and spiders utilize van der Waals forces to climb and cling on to smooth surfaces.\\n# Crystal Structure\\nSpace lattice or crystal can be defined as any arrangement of atoms in space such that every atom is situated similar to every atom. Space lattice may be the result of primary or secondary bonds.\\nThere are 14 possible lattice type forms, but many of the metals used in dentistry belong to the cubic system. The simplest cubic space lattice is shown in Figs. 2.3A to C. The solid circles represent the position of the atoms. Their positions are located at the points of intersection of three sets of parallel planes, each set being perpendicular to other planes. These planes are often referred to as crystal planes.\\n|Simple cubic|Body centered cubic|Face centered cubic|\\n|---|---|---|\\n|A|B|C|\\n2: Geckos can stick to walls and ceilings because of van der Waals forces.\\n3A to C: Crystal structure.\\n---',\n",

In noncrystalline structures or amorphous structures, e.g. waxes, the arrangement of atoms in the lattice is disorderly and distributed at random. There is, however, a tendency for the arrangement of atoms or molecules to be regular, for example, glass is considered to be a noncrystalline solid, yet its atoms bind to form a short-range order rather than long-range order lattice. In other words, the ordered arrangement of glass is localized with a large number of disordered units between the ordered units. Since such an arrangement is also typical of liquids, such solids are, sometimes, called supercooled liquids.',\n",
       " 'The distance between two atoms is known as interatomic distance. This interatomic distance depends upon the electrostatic fields of the electrons. If the atoms come too close to each other, they are repelled from each other by their electrons charges. On the other hand, forces of attraction keep them from separating. Thus the atoms are kept together at a position where these forces of repulsion and attraction become equal in magnitude (but opposite in direction). This is the normal equilibrium position of the atoms. The normal position of the atoms can be changed by the application of mechanical force. For example, the interatomic distance can be increased by a force pulling them apart. If the displacing force is measured across a given area it is known as stress and the change in dimension is called a strain. In simple words, stress is the force applied and strain is the resulting change in shape. Theoretically, a stress and a strain exist whenever the interatomic distance is changed from the equilibrium position. If the stress pulling the atoms apart exceeds the resultant force of attraction, the atoms may separate completely, and the bonds holding them together are broken. Strain can also occur under compression. However, in this case, the strain produced is limited because when the atoms come closer than their normal interatomic distance, a sudden increase in energy is seen.\\nThe diffusion of molecules in gases and liquids is well known. However, molecules or atoms diffuse in the solid state as well. Diffusion rates depend mainly on the temperature. The higher the temperature, the greater will be the rate of diffusion. The diffusion rate will, however, vary with the atom size, interatomic or intermolecular bonding lattice imperfections. Thus every material has its own diffusion rate. The diffusion rate in noncrystalline materials may occur at a rapid rate and often may be seen.\\n---\\n|A|B|\\n|---|---|',\n",

In summary, the greater the surface energy, the greater will be the capacity for adhesion.| |\\nIt is very difficult to force two solid surfaces to adhere. However smooth their surfaces may appear, they are likely to be very rough at the atomic or molecular level. When they are placed together, only the ‘hills’ or high spots are in contact. Since these areas form only a small percentage of the total surface, no adhesion takes place. For proper adhesion, the distance between the surface molecules should not be greater than 0.0007 micrometer or micron (μm). One method of overcoming this difficulty is to use a fluid that will flow into these irregularities and thus provide contact over a great part of the surface of the solid. For example, when two glass plates are placed one on top of the other, they do not usually adhere. However, if a film of water is placed in between them, it becomes difficult to separate the two plates.\\nTo produce adhesion in this manner, the liquid must flow easily over the entire surface and adhere to the solid. This characteristic is referred to as wetting. The degree of wetting is indicated by the contact angle of the adhesive to the adherend.\\n|Contact Angle = 0|Perfect wetting|\\n|---|---|\\n|Contact Angle = 0 < <90°|High wettability|\\n|Contact Angle = 90° ≤< 180°|Low wettability|\\n|Contact Angle = 180°|Perfect non-wetting|\\n---\\nIf the forces of adhesion are stronger than the cohesive forces holding the molecules of the adhesive together, the liquid will spread completely over the surface of the solid and no angle will be formed (e.g. water on a soapy surface ( If the liquid remains as a drop without spreading, the contact angle will be high (e.g. water on an oily surface,',\n",

Surfactants may act as detergents, wetting agents, emulsifiers, foaming agents, and dispersants. Surfactants are added to some dental materials to improve wetting.\\n1. The mouth is a highly moist environment and impression materials used in the mouth should be hydrophilic in order to record details even under moist conditions.\\n2. Good wettability is again desired in the laboratory for products contacting gypsum products like dental stone and plaster which have a high moisture content. While pouring casts the stone should be able to wet the impression well in order to minimize voids.\\n3. Good wetting is important in soldering in order to produce a good strong joint.\\n# Properties of Dental Materials\\nTo select and use a dental material one must understand its properties. Knowledge of the properties of the material predicts its behavior, functioning in the mouth and longevity. Accordingly one can optimize design and techniques in order to get the best out of a particular material.\\n# Mechanical Properties\\nA mechanical property is the behavior of the material when it’s linked to the application of force. The mechanical properties of a material describe how it will react to physical forces.\\nWhen a force acts on the body, tending to produce deformation, a resistance is developed within the body to this external force. The internal resistance of the body to the external force is called stress. Stress is equal and opposite in direction to the force (external) applied. This external force is also known as load. Since both applied force and internal resistance (stress) are distributed over a given area of the body, the stress in a structure is designated as a force per unit area.\\n---',\n",
       " '---\\nThe internal resistance to force (stress) is impractical to measure. The convenient way is to measure the external force applied to the cross-sectional area. Area over which the force acts is an important factor especially in dental restorations in which areas over which the forces applied often are extremely small. Stress at a constant force is inversely proportional to the area—the smaller the area, the larger the stress and vice versa.\\nResults in a body when it is subjected to two sets of forces that are directed away from each other in the same straight line. The load tends to stretch or elongate a body.\\nResults when the body is subjected to two sets of forces in the same straight line but directed towards each other. The load tends to or shortens a body.\\nShear stress is a result of two forces directed parallel to each other. A stress that tends to resist a twisting motion, or a sliding of one portion of a body over another is a shear or shearing stress.\\nIf the stress (internal resistance) produced is not sufficient to withstand the external force (load) the body undergoes a change in shape (deformation). Each type of stress is capable of producing a corresponding deformation in the body. The deformation resulting from a tension, or pulling force, produces an elongation of a body, whereas a compression, or pushing force, causes compression or shortening of the body.\\nStrain is expressed as change in length per unit length of the body when a stress is applied. It is a dimensionless quantity and may be elastic or plastic or a combination of the two.',\n",
       " \"Strain is expressed as change in length per unit length of the body when a stress is applied. It is a dimensionless quantity and may be elastic or plastic or a combination of the two.\\nIt is difficult to induce just a single type of stress in a body. Whenever force is applied over a body, complex or multiple stresses are produced. These may be a combination of tensile, shear or compressive stresses. These multiple stresses are called complex stresses. For example, when a wire is stretched, the predominant stress is tensile, but shearing and compressive stresses will also be present because the wire is getting thinner (compressed in cross-section) as it elongates.\\n|Shear|Compress|Shear|\\n|---|---|---|\\n|Tension| | |\\n6 Complex stresses produced by a three-point loading of a beam.\\n---\\n# Poission's Ratio\\nIf we take a cylinder and subject it to a tensile stress or compressive stress, there is simultaneous axial and lateral strain. Within the elastic range, the ratio of the lateral to the axial strain is called Poisson's ratio.\\n# Proportional Limit\\nA tensile load is applied to a wire in small increments until it breaks. If each stress is plotted on a vertical coordinate and the corresponding strain (change in length) is plotted on the horizontal coordinate, a curve is obtained. This is known as a stress-strain curve. It is useful to study some of the mechanical properties. The stress-strain curve is a straight line up to point 'P' after which it curves.\\nThe point 'P' is the proportional limit, i.e., up to point 'P' the stress is proportional to strain (Hooke's Law). Beyond 'P' the strain is no longer elastic and so stress is no longer proportional to strain. Thus proportional stress can be defined as the greatest stress that may be produced in a material such that the stress is directly proportional to strain.\\n# Elastic Limit\",\n",
       " \"# Elastic Limit\\nBelow the proportional limit (point 'P'), a material is elastic in nature, that is, if the load is removed, the material will return to its original shape. Thus elastic limit may be defined as the maximum stress that a material will withstand without permanent deformation (change in shape). For all practical purposes, the elastic limit and the proportional limit represent the same stress. However, the fundamental concept is different, one describes the elastic behavior of the material whereas the other deals with proportionality of strain to stress in the structure.\\n# Yield Strength\\nVery few materials follow Hooke's law perfectly and some permanent change may be seen in the tested material. A small amount of permanent strain is tolerable. The limit of tolerable permanent strain is the yield strength. Thus yield strength is defined as the stress at which a material exhibits a specified limiting deviation from proportionality of stress to strain.\\nHow much of permanent deformation can be tolerated? This varies from material to material and is determined by selecting an offset. An offset is an arbitrary value put for a material. It represents the percent of total permanent deformation that is acceptable for the material.\\nStress-strain curve. P-proportional limit, X-yield strength, S-offset.\\n---\\ndentistry 0.1% (1% offset) and 0.2% (2% offset) are most commonly used. The yield strength is determined by selecting the desired offset and drawing a line parallel to the linear region of the stress-strain curve ( The point on the stress-strain curve where the offset meets is the yield strength (point X).\\nIt is also referred to as ‘elastic modulus’ or ‘Young’s modulus’. It represents the relative stiffness or rigidity of the material within the elastic range. Young’s modulus is the ratio of stress to strain. Since stress is proportional to strain (up to the proportional limit), the stress to strain ratio would be constant.\",\n",

Depending upon the resilience of the object, energy is stored in the body without causing deformation or with deformation.\\nFrom the above formula, we can conclude Impact resistance will be decreased with an increase in the modulus of elasticity, which means that stiffer materials will have less impact resistance. Resilient materials will have better impact resistance (however, a high stiffness is also necessary to provide rigidity to a material under static loads, e.g. a cement base should be able to support an amalgam restoration). Increase in volume leads to an increase in impact resistance.\\nIt is the energy required to fracture a material under an impact force. A Charpy type impact tester is used (Figs. 2.9A and B). It has a heavy pendulum which swings down to fracture the specimen. Another instrument called Izod impact tester can also be used.\\n|Scale|Hammer|\\n|---|---|',\n",

However due to its elastic nature, it recovers its shape and little permanent deformation occurs. Some materials are more elastic than others.

It is also known as ‘life data analysis’. The primary advantage of Weibull analysis is the ability to provide reasonably accurate failure analysis and failure forecasts. Thus it is used to estimate important life characteristics of a product such as reliability or probability of failure at a specific time, the mean life for the product and failure rate.',\n",

       " 'Knowledge of the causes and effects of stress concentration is important in dental restorations to prevent early failure.\\nAn object is strongest when force is evenly distributed over its area, so a reduction in area, e.g. caused by a crack, results in a localized increase in stress. A material can fail, via a propagating crack, when a concentrated stress exceeds the material’s theoretical cohesive strength. The real fracture strength of a material is always lower than the theoretical value because most materials contain small cracks or contaminants (especially foreign particles) that concentrate stress.\\nA structure should be designed in such a way that stress is evenly distributed. An example of a stress concentration design is a narrow post with supporting a large core. The weakest point of this structure is at the junction of the post and core. When occlusal forces are applied stress concentration at this point can lead to a fracture. Slight alteration of design can reduce stress concentration. In this case increasing the diameter of the post and increasing the bulk of the metal at the junction of the post to the core so that the transition is gradual rather than abrupt.\\nA structure subjected to repeated or cyclic stresses below its proportional limit can produce abrupt failure of the structure. This type of failure is called fatigue. Fatigue behavior is determined by subjecting a material to a cyclic stress of a known value and determining the number of cycles that are required to produce failure. The stresses used in fatigue testing are usually very low. However, the repeated application causes failure.\\nRestorations in the mouth are often subjected to cyclic forces of mastication.

This property enables manufacturers to beat it into thin foils. Silver is second. Among other metals, platinum ranks third in ductility and copper ranks third in malleability.\\n---\\nHardness is difficult to define specifically. There are numerous factors which influence the hardness of a material such as strength, proportional limit, ductility, malleability, etc. In mineralogy the hardness is described as the ability of a material to resist scratching. In metallurgy and in most other fields, the resistance to indentation is taken as the measure of hardness. There are many surface hardness tests.\\nThe Brinell hardness scale was developed by a Swedish engineer named Johan August Brinell in 1900. The Brinell test utilizes a 10 mm diameter steel ball as an indenter, applying a uniform 3000 kgf (29 kN) force. A smaller amount of force is used on softer materials and a tungsten carbide ball is used for harder materials. The diameter of the indentation left in the test material is measured with a low powered microscope. The load is divided by the area of the surface of the indentation and the quotient is referred to as Brinell Hardness Number (BHN).\\nUsed for measuring hardness of metals and metallic materials.\\nLike the Brinell test, a steel ball or a conical diamond point is used.

The symbol most often used for density is ρ (the lower case Greek letter rho). Mathematically, density is defined as mass divided by volume– ρ = m/V where ρ is the density, m is the mass, and V is the volume. In some cases (for instance, in the United States oil and gas industry), density is loosely defined as its weight per unit volume, although this is scientifically inaccurate—this quantity is more specifically called specific weight. For a pure substance, the density has the same numerical value as its mass concentration. Different materials usually have different densities. Osmium and iridium are the densest known elements at standard conditions for temperature and pressure. To simplify comparisons of density across different systems of units, it is sometimes replaced by the dimensionless quantity “relative density” or “specific gravity”, i.e. the ratio of the density of the material to that of a standard material, usually water. Thus a relative density less than one means that the substance floats in water. The density of a material varies with temperature and pressure. This variation is typically small for solids and liquids but much greater for gases. Increasing the pressure on an object decreases the volume of the object and thus increases its density. Increasing the temperature of a substance (with a few exceptions) decreases its density by increasing its volume.\\n# Glass Transition Temperature (Tg)',\n",
       " '# Glass Transition Temperature (Tg)\\nThe glass transition temperature (Tg) is the temperature at which an amorphous solid becomes soft upon heating or brittle upon cooling. The Tg is one of the most important properties of any epoxy and is the temperature region where the polymer transitions from a hard, glassy material to a soft, rubbery material. The glass transition temperature is always lower than the melting temperature (Tm) of the crystalline state of the material, if one exists. Glass transition temperature is the most important property of a polymer. The value of the glass transition temperature is directly related to the mechanical properties (strength, hardness, brittleness, elongation, etc.). The glass transition temperature is more important in plastics applications than is the melting point, because it tells a lot about how the polymer behaves under ambient conditions. If a polymer’s glass transition temperature is well above ambient room temperature, the material behaves like a brittle glassy polymer (it is stiff with low impact resistance).\\n---',\n",

The coefficient of thermal expansion describes how the size of an object changes with a change in temperature. It measures the fractional change in size per degree change in temperature at constant pressure.\\nThere are different types of coefficients - volumetric, area, and linear, used based on the application. Solids may use linear or area coefficients, while fluids and gases use volumetric coefficients. The volumetric thermal expansion coefficient is typically expressed in parts per million per degree Celsius rise in temperature (ppm/K).\\nα\\n=\\n- α (alpha) is CTE\\n- L is the original length of the material\\n- ΔL (delta L) is the change in length\\n- ΔT (delta T) is the change in temperature\\nSome materials contract on heating within specific temperature ranges, known as negative thermal expansion. For instance, the coefficient of thermal expansion of water decreases to zero at 3.983°C and becomes negative below this temperature.\\n---\\nthis means that water has a maximum density at this temperature, and this leads to bodies of water maintaining this temperature at their lower depths during extended periods of sub-zero weather. Another example is pure silicon. It has a negative coefficient of thermal expansion for temperatures between about 18 and 120 Kelvin.\\n- The mismatch of thermal expansion and contraction between restorative materials and tooth may cause stresses at their interface, which may lead to microleakage.\\n- Metal ceramics restorations require a close match between the CTE of the alloy and porcelain in order to reduce stresses in the porcelain. These stresses can cause immediate or delayed cracking in the ceramic.\\n- An inlay wax pattern created in the mouth may contract when transferred to the colder room.\\n- Denture teeth set in wax may shift slightly when room temperature changes.',\n",

The eye is sensitive to wavelengths from approximately 400 nm (violet) to 700 nm (dark red). The combined intensities of the wavelengths present in a beam of light determine the property called color. In order for an object to be visible, either it must emit light or it must reflect or transmit light falling upon it from an external source. Objects of dental interest generally transmit light. The incident light is usually polychromatic (mixed light of various wavelengths). The reaction of an object to the incident light is to selectively absorb and/or scatter certain wavelengths. The spectral distribution of the transmitted or reflected light will resemble that of the incident light although certain wavelengths will be reduced in magnitude. Cone-shaped cells in the retina are responsible for color vision in humans. The eye is most sensitive to light in the green-yellow region and least sensitive at either extremes (i.e., red or blue).\\nThe three dimensions of color are — hue, value and chroma.\\nRefers to the basic color of an object, e.g. whether it is red, green or blue.\\nColors can be separated into ‘light’ and ‘dark’ shades. Value represents the amount of lightness or darkness in the color. This lightness which can be measured independently of the hue is called value.',\n",
       " 'A particular color may be dull or more ‘vivid’, this difference in color intensity or strength is called chroma. Chroma represents the degree of saturation of a particular hue (color). In other words, the higher the chroma, the more intense is the color. Chroma cannot exist by itself and is always associated with hue and value. The three dimensions of color is represented in Figs. 2.19 and 2.20.\\n---\\n# Measurement of color\\nOne of the most commonly used methods to define and measure color quantitatively is the Munsell System. It is a coordinate system that can be viewed as a cylinder. The lines are arranged sequentially around the perimeter of the cylinder, while the chroma increases along a radius from the axis. The value coordinate varies along the length of the cylinder from black at the bottom to neutral grey at the center to white at the top.\\n# Metamerism\\nThe appearance of an object depends on the type of light by which the object is viewed. Daylight, incandescent lamps, and fluorescent lamps are all common sources of light in the dental operatory. Objects that appear to be color matched under one type of light may appear very different under another light source. This phenomenon is called metamerism.\\n# Tooth Esthetics\\n- Shape\\n- Color\\n- Texture\\nThe shade and color of a tooth are a complex interplay of many factors. The color of the tooth is determined by the shade, thickness, and composition of the enamel and dentin, the pulp chamber, extrinsic stains, color reflections from the gum and adjacent teeth, and the incident light itself. Light is a form of energy and must obey the basic law of conservation of energy, which states that energy cannot be created or destroyed but only changed from one form into another or transferred from one object to another.\\n|Light|=|Light|+|Light|+|Light|+|Light|+|Light|+|Light|changed|\\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\\n|Incident|Reflected|Scattered|Transmitted|Absorbed|Fluoresced|to heat| | | | | | | |',\n",

For example, plain glass is transparent.\\n---\\nfrosted glass is translucent. An object which does not allow any passage of light is said to be opaque.\\nrelevance Teeth and oral tissue are translucent and allow passage of some of the incident light. In some individuals, the enamel may be translucent or in rare circumstances transparent. This may be particularly evident in the incisal edges of upper or lower incisors. Metal-ceramic restorations are opaque unlike natural teeth which are translucent ( One of the reasons for improved esthetics with all-ceramic restorations is the improved translucency.\\nfluorescence Natural tooth structure also absorbs light of wavelengths which are too short to be visible to the human eye. These wavelengths between 300 to 400 nm are referred as near ultraviolet. Natural sunlight, photoflash lamps, certain types of vapor lamps and the ultraviolet lights used in decorative lighting are all sources containing substantial amounts of near U-V radiation and invisible U-V light (also called black light). This energy that the tooth absorbs is converted into light with larger wavelengths, in which case the tooth actually becomes a light source. The phenomenon is called fluorescence ( The emitted light is primarily in 400-450 nm range, having blue white color. Improved fluorescence adds esthetic value to artificial restorations.',\n",
       " 'relevance In UV light a natural tooth emits a weak whitish-blue fluorescence. This should be taken into account when selecting restoratives. If restorative materials do not offer this property of fluorescence, they will look dark in UV light ( Some patients want their restorations to match natural tooth under fluorescent light conditions, e.g. in stage shows and discotheques. Some porcelain restorations are able to match the natural teeth under fluorescent lighting.\\n|21|Poor translucency exhibited by the metal-ceramic restoration on the right when compared to the natural teeth (left).|\\n|---|---|\\n|22|Composite restoration (on right central incisor) showing greater fluorescence.|\\n|23|Artificial crown on left central appears dark under UV light because of insufficient fluorescence.|\\n---\\n# clINIcal coNSIDeratIoNS\\nEsthetics play a very important role in modern dental treatment. The ideal restorative material should match the color of the tooth it restores. In maxillofacial prosthetics the color of the gums, external skin and the eyes have to be duplicated. Clinically in the operatory or dental lab, color selection is usually done by the use of shade guides ( These are used in much the same way as paint chips are used to select the color for house paint. The process of selection is described in (Figs. 2.25A to C).\\nDigital shade guides are also available (Figs. 2.26A to C). The probe is simply placed against the tooth and on the press of a button the reading is displayed on the screen. The device is also useful to measure the progress of bleaching.\\n# raDIoloGIcal ProPertIeS\\n|A|R|R|\\n|---|---|---|',\n",

Its history can be traced back to 6000 BCE.

Collectively these were called the seven metals of antiquity. Over time more and more metals were discovered, greatly revolutionizing human evolution and culture. Zinc was known to the Chinese in the 1400s. Platinum was discovered in Mexico by the Spaniards. Aluminium was first produced by Christian Oersted in 1825.\\n|Tungsten|Pure tungsten has some unique properties including the highest melting point (3695 K), lowest vapor pressure, and greatest tensile strength out of all the metals.

This table showed that when the elements were ordered by increasing atomic weight, a pattern appeared where properties of the elements repeated periodically. Thus the periodic table is a chart that groups the elements according to their similar properties.',\n",
       " 'The periodic table helps predict some properties of the elements compared to each other. Atom size decreases as you move from left to right across the table and increases as you move down a column. Energy required to remove an electron from an atom increases as you move from left to right and decreases as you move down a column. The ability to form a chemical bond increases as you move from left to right and decreases as you move down a column. There are 118 elements in the periodic table. Roughly 80 percent (94) of these elements are classified as metals.\\nColumns of elements help define element groups. Elements within a group share several common properties. Groups of elements have the same outer electron arrangement. The outer electrons are called valence electrons. Because they have the same number of valence electrons, elements in a group share similar chemical properties.\\n# General Properties of Metals\\n1. Most metals are solid except for hydrogen which is a gas, and mercury and gallium which is liquid at room temperature.\\n2. Good thermal and electrical conductivity.\\n3. Hard, strong and dense.\\n4.

       " 'Metals are tough because atoms of the metals are held together by means of metallic bonds. Metallic bond is the bonding between molecules within metals (also called alkali reactive force).\\nIn metals, valence electrons are shared by all the atoms of the metal and so are not considered to be associated with any one atom. This is very different from ionic or covalent bonds, where electrons are held by one or two atoms. The sea of shared ‘delocalised electrons’ amongst a lattice of positive ions acts as a kind of “electron glue” giving the substance a definite structure.\\nThe metallic bond is, therefore, strong and uniform. Since electrons are attracted to many atoms, they have considerable mobility to be good conductors of heat and electricity.\\nMetallic bonds, though strong, also allow movement of the individual atoms. This property allows metals to be hammered into sheets or drawn into wires.\\n# Alloys\\nMost metals used in dentistry are used in the alloyed form. Examples of alloys in dentistry are steel, chrome-cobalt, nickel-chrome, gold-palladium, etc.\\nOne of the first alloys made by humans was bronze, which is made by mixing the metals tin and copper.\\n# Definition\\nAn alloy is a material composed of two more elements; at least one of which should be a metal. Thus an alloy is made by fusing two or more metals, or a metal and a nonmetal.\\nAn alloy may be a solid solution of the elements (a single phase), a mixture of metallic phases (two or more solutions) or an intermetallic compound with no distinct boundary between the phases.\\nSolid solution alloys give a single solid phase microstructure, while partial solutions exhibit two or more phases that may or may not be homogeneous in distribution, depending on the thermal (heat treatment) history of the material. An inter-metallic compound has one other alloy or pure metal embedded within another pure metal.',\n",

Thus a knowledge of the behavior of alloys during melting and solidification is beneficial.\\nAlloys may be prepared by different technological methods: melting, sintering of a powder mixture, high temperature diffusion of an alloying element into the base metal, plasma and vapor deposition of different elements, electroplating, etc.\\nA phase is a uniform part of an alloy, having a certain chemical composition and structure, and which is separated from other alloy constituents by a phase boundary. An alloy phase may be in the form of a compound (substance formed from two or more elements), with a fixed ratio determining the composition) or in form of solid solution.\\nCan one metal dissolve in another?\\nTwo or more metals can dissolve to form solutions.

This property is used in the creation of dental amalgam.',\n",
       " 'A solid solution is a solid-state solution of one or more solutes in a solvent. Such a mixture is considered a solution rather than a compound when the crystal structure of the solvent remains unchanged by addition of the solutes, and when the mixture remains in a single homogeneous phase. This often happens when the two elements (generally metals) involved are close together on the periodic table; conversely, a chemical compound generally results when two metals involved are not near each other on the periodic table. The solid solution needs to be distinguished from a mechanical mixture of powdered solids like two salts, sugar and salt, etc. The mechanical mixtures have total or partial miscibility gap in solid state.

The microstructure of a material can strongly influence physical properties such as strength, toughness, ductility, hardness, corrosion resistance, high/low-temperature behavior, wear resistance, and so on, which in turn, govern the application of these materials in laboratory and clinical practice. Microstructure at scales smaller than can be viewed with optical microscopes is often called ultrastructure or nanostructure.',\n",
       " \"Solidification occurs by a process of crystallization. Crystallization begins around a nucleus. Crystals are also known as grains as they seldom show the customary crystal shapes because of interference from neighboring crystals. The crystallization process results in various types of microstructures depending on the type of metal or alloy and the cooling process. The crystals are otherwise known as grains since they seldom exhibit the customary geometric forms due to interference from adjacent crystals during the change of state.\\nSurface tension of liquid metal is 10 times higher than that of water. When molten alloy cools, the solidification process begins with the formation of atom clusters called 'embryos' or 'nuclei of crystallization'.\\n# 5 Illustration of grain growth and solidification\\n---\\n# 6 Photomicrograph showing dendritic structure.\\n# Crystallization Forms\\n- Equiaxed grains\\n- Columnar grains\\n# Dendritic microstructure\\nIn the dendritic form, the crystals that form in the liquid during freezing generally follow a pattern consisting of a main branch with many appendages. A crystal with this morphology slightly resembles a pine tree and is called a dendrite, which means branching. The formation of dendrites occurs because crystals grow in defined planes due to the crystal lattice they create. Secondary dendrite arms branch off the primary arm, and tertiary arms off the secondary arms, etc., resulting in a three-dimensional dendritic structure ( Dental base metal alloys and titanium-based casting alloys in which nickel (N), cobalt (Co), iron (Fe), and titanium (Ti) are the main elements generally have a dendritic as cast microstructure.\\n# Equiaxed polycrystalline microstructure\",\n",
       " '# Equiaxed polycrystalline microstructure\\nEquiaxed grains are crystals that have axes of approximately the same length. The crystal grows from multiple nucleation points. The expanding crystals continue to grow until they impinge on adjacent growing crystals at grain boundaries. The final sizes of the individual crystals depend on the number of nucleation points. Most noble metal casting alloys solidify with this type of microstructure. Dental noble metal alloys generally have equiaxed fine-grain microstructures because of certain grain refining elements added into the composition.\\n# Columnar polycrystalline alloys\\nColumnar grain structured castings are created using a special casting technique called ‘directional solidification’. They have grains parallel to the major stress axes. They are less prone to creep deformation compared to equiaxed grain structured metal components.\\n# Single crystal\\n---\\nto produce a single large crystal, so there are no grain boundaries in the material ( Single crystals are produced under carefully controlled conditions. The expense of producing single crystal materials is only justified for special applications, such as turbine engine blades, solar cells, and piezoelectric materials. Jet engine turbine blades must endure tremendous forces at extremely high temperatures for prolonged periods of time. Under such conditions, metals with a grain structure tend to “creep,” or slowly deform, along grain boundaries. Because single-crystal alloy parts have no grain boundaries they are highly resistant to creep.\\n8 Photomicrograph of aluminium alloy (Al-Mg-Fe-Si containing < 1 wt.% of each solute) showing equiaxed grain structure.

During the supercooling process crystals of metal begin to form. Crystallization releases latent heat of fusion causing a rise in temperature (B1 to B). Completion of crystallization occurs at point C. Between B and C the metal has both liquid and solid phases. The temperature remains steady (plateau) until crystallization is completed. Point D indicates cooling to room temperature.\\n# Equilibrium Phase Diagrams\\nA phase diagram is also known as a constitutional diagram. It helps to identify the phases present in an alloy at different compositions and temperatures. The phase diagram may be explained using the example of the palladium-silver alloy. The two metals exhibit complete solubility in liquid and solid states. The equilibrium phase diagram of Pd-Ag at a composition of 65% Pd and 35% Ag is presented in 11.\\n# Homogenization Heat Treatment - Microstructure',\n",
       " '# Homogenization Heat Treatment - Microstructure\\nFrom the phase diagram of the palladium-silver alloy, it is evident that the composition of the structure is not uniform. The grains that form early on during solidification have a higher palladium content compared to the layers that solidify later. Thus the core contains dendrites of varying or nonuniform composition. Heat treatments can be used to homogenize cast metal alloys to improve their hot workability, to soften metals prior to, and during hot and cold processing operations, or to alter their microstructure in such a way as to achieve the desired mechanical properties.\\n# Definition\\nHomogenization heat treatment can be defined as a combination of heating and cooling operations applied to a metal or alloy in its solid state to eliminate as cast nonuniform compositional variations (coring effect) to a more uniform equiaxed grain structure through atomic diffusion.\\n# Procedure\\nThe heat treatment of metals involves raising the temperature of an alloy to a defined temperature, usually near its solidus.

At ‘R’ the alloy begins to solidify. However the first crystals have a higher Pd content than the expected 65 %. To determine the exact percentage composition of the first crystals a line is extended from ‘R’ to ‘M’ on the solidus line. Point ‘M’ determines the composition of the first solids which is 77% Pd. At ‘S’ it is midway through its solidification. Here the composition of the solid is determined as 71% Pd (Point W). The liquid composition is 57% Pd (Point Y). As it cools to the solidus line (1340 °C) Point ‘T’ the solid phase has 65 % palladium and the remainder of the liquid solidifies at a composition of only 52% Pd.

Therefore these alloys do not form solid solutions. Rather, eutectic alloys upon cooling, convert from liquids to intimately mixed solids.\\nIn an eutectic system, the “eutectic alloy” composition has the lowest melting point in the system.

       " '# Solid state reactions\\nKnowledge of solid-state reactions is important to understand strengthening mechanisms in Type III and IV gold alloys like age hardening. Solid state reactions can be explained through the gold-copper phase diagram.\\n# Gold-Copper Phase Diagram\\nGold and copper are completely soluble in each other in the liquid state. The gold-copper equilibrium phase diagram is presented in ( The difference between the liquidus and solidus is small at all compositions. The two curves meet at 80.1%. This composition marks the lowest temperature at which a gold-copper alloy can melt. At temperatures between the solidus and 410°C the gold and copper are mutually soluble and form a disordered solid solution (α). The atoms are in random arrangement in an FCC structure. However, as the alloy cools down further, certain solid state transformations are seen. The various phases on cooling at various compositions are summed up in Table 3.1.\\n---\\n|Phase|Temperature|Composition range|\\n|---|---|---|\\n|Disordered α phase (Au-Cu)|Between solidus and 410 °C|40–65%|\\n|Ordered α’ phase (Au-Cu)|Below 390 °C|40–65%|\\n|Ordered α’’2 phase (Au-Cu II)|Below 410 °C|65–85%|\\n|Ordered α’’1 phase (Au-Cu I)|Below 410 °C|65–85%|',\n",

The disordered phase (α phase) on the other hand is relatively soft and ductile. This soft ductile phase is convenient for laboratory finishing and grinding procedures. The disordered phase which exists at the higher temperatures can be preserved by rapid quenching. Rapid cooling prevents atomic movement to the more ordered lower temperature phases. Following adjustments of the crown, the alloy is again age hardened by holding it at specified temperature for a specified period. This permits the solid state reactions to take place (through atomic fusion) and convert the alloy to its mechanically superior ordered phases (α’, α’’2 , and α’’1). The alloys can be restored to its softened condition by again raising it to a temperature just below its solidus (700oC) and holding it at this temperature for 10 minutes and then rapidly quenching.\\nThus essentially, gold alloys can be both softened and hardened through heat treatment.\\n---\\n# Homogenization\\nThis treatment is used prior to hot working processes and is performed to equalize temperatures throughout an alloy or to reduce the coring effect caused by the nonuniform chemical composition.\\n# Softening heat treatment\\nSynonyms: Solution heat treatment, annealing.\\nSoftening heat treatment covers a variety of heat treatment processes used to soften alloys and increase their ductility as an aid to cold working. It is also performed to remove internal stresses within components following cold working, welding, casting, or rapid cooling.\\n# Hardening heat treatment\\nHardening heat treatment is a heat treatment technique used to increase the strength of malleable materials, including most structural alloys of nickel, titanium, and some stainless steels.\\n# Classification of alloys',\n",

TEC mismatch can cause fracture or separation of the veneer from the metal. Silver increases CTE whereas palladium lowers the CTE in the alloy.\\nGenerally metals with higher melting points raise the melting range, whereas metals with lower melting point tend to lower the melting range of the corresponding alloys. Example, silver reduces the melting range of palladium and gold alloys. Palladium and platinum raise the melting range of gold-based alloys.',\n",
       " 'The castability of a material is the ease with which a casting can be produced with minimal energy and defects. Generally castability is related to the density of a material. Denser metals improve the castability of the alloy. Noble alloys are generally more easy to cast because of their greater density when compared to base metal alloys like cobalt-chromium.\\nZinc is added to remove oxygen during the casting process, thereby reducing porosity.\\nTarnish and corrosion resistance is a desirable property especially in the oral environment. Improving the concentration of noble metals improve the tarnish and corrosion resistance of an alloy. In base metal alloys, the mechanism for tarnish and corrosion resistance is different. In chrome-based alloys, a surface oxide is readily formed. The surface oxide forms a protective layer which protects the metal from further corrosion. This property is called ‘passivation’. Other metals which use a similar mechanism is stainless steel and titanium.\\nIn certain instances like large cast removable partial dentures, a light weight framework is preferable to a more heavier frame in terms of patient comfort and appliance retention. Base metal alloys are popular as RPD alloys because of their low density. Palladium being lighter than gold lowers the density and weight of gold-palladium-based alloys.

They occur in the form of minerals such as oxides and sulfides and these have to be refined to produce the pure metal. Most pure metals attempt to reconvert to the combined state. The process by which this takes place is called corrosion. One of the primary requisites of any metal that is to be used in the mouth is that it must not produce corrosion products that will be harmful to the body. The mouth is moist and continually subjected to fluctuations in temperature. The foods and liquids ingested have a wide range of pH. All these factors make the mouth an extremely favorable environment for corrosion.\\n# Definitions\\nTarnish is a surface discoloration on a metal or even a slight loss or alteration of the surface finish or lustre.\\n1.

For example, chromium alloys (used in dental castings) are protected from corrosion by the formation of an oxide layer on its surface which protects the metal against any further corrosion. This is known as passivation. Another example is titanium.\\n# COrrOSION',\n",
       " '# COrrOSION\\nIt is not a surface discoloration but actual deterioration of a metal by reaction with the environment. It can be defined as the deterioration of metals by chemical interaction with their environment. Most metals exist in their stable oxide state in nature except for some of the noble metals like gold. Metals are refined from these natural ores to produce the pure metals and alloys. However, the pure state of metals is unstable. Corrosion is a natural process, which converts refined metal to their more stable forms. In the most common use of the word, this means electrochemical oxidation of metal in reaction with an oxidant such as oxygen. Rusting, the formation of iron oxides, is a well-known example of electrochemical corrosion. This type of damage typically produces oxides or salts of the original metal. However, elements other than oxygen also can cause corrosion particularly in the oral environment. Water, oxygen, chloride ions, sulfides like hydrogen sulfide or ammonium sulfide contribute to corrosion attack in the oral cavity. Various acids such as phosphoric, acetic, and lactic are also present. Among the specific ions responsible for corrosion, oxygen and chloride have been implicated in amalgam corrosion both at the tooth interface and within the body of amalgam. Sulfide has been implicated in the corrosion of silver-containing casting alloys. Corrosion degrades the useful properties of materials and structures including strength and appearance.

Thus, a microscopic space always exists between the restoration and the prepared cavity. The use of radioisotope tracers, dyes, scanning electron microscope, and other techniques have clearly shown that fluids, microorganisms, and oral debris can penetrate freely along the interface between the restoration and the tooth and progress down the walls of the cavity preparation. This phenomenon is referred to as microleakage.\\n1. Recurrent or secondary caries - The seepage of acids and microorganisms could initiate caries around the margins of the restoration. Recurrent caries if left unchecked can lead to loss of the restoration and destruction of tooth structure.\\n2. Stain or discoloration can also develop.\\n3.

The temperature fluctuations can crack the restorative materials or produce undesirable dimensional changes in them because of thermal expansion and contraction. Many restorative materials are composed of metals. Metals conduct heat and cold rapidly. Patients may often complain of sensitivity in a tooth with a metallic restoration when they are eating hot or cold foods. The problem is more in a very large restoration, where the layer of dentin remaining at the floor of the cavity may be so thin that it is not adequate to insulate the pulp against the temperature shock.',\n",
       " 'Protection from thermal changes The dentist must place a layer of insulating cement (called base) under the restoration. galvanism Another cause for sensitivity is the small currents created whenever two different metals are present in the oral cavity. The presence of metallic restorations in the mouth may cause a phenomenon called galvanic action or galvanism. This results from a difference in potential between dissimilar fillings in opposing or adjacent teeth. These fillings in conjunction with saliva as electrolyte make up an electric cell. When two opposing fillings contact each other, the cell is short-circuited and the patient experiences pain. A similar effect may occur when a restoration is touched by the edge of a metal fork. Studies have shown that relatively large currents can flow. The current rapidly drops if the fillings are maintained in contact, probably as a result of polarization of the cell. The magnitude of the voltage is not of primary importance, but the sensitivity of the patient to the current has a greater influence on whether he will feel pain. Some patients may feel pain at 10 μ amp and other at 110 μ amp (average: 20 to 50 μ amp). That is why some patients are bothered by galvanic action and others are not despite similar conditions in the mouth. The galvanic current magnitude depends on the composition and surface area of the metals. Stainless steel develops a higher current density than either gold or cobalt chromium alloys when in contact with an amalgam restoration. As the size of the cathode (e.g. a gold alloy) increases relative to that of the anode (e.g. amalgam), the current density may increase. The larger cathode can enhance the corrosion of the smaller anode. Current densities associated with non γ-containing amalgams appear to be less than those associated with γ-containing amalgam.',\n",

The teeth are then extracted periodically and compared with negative controls (ZOE cement) and positive controls (silicate cement).\\n# Level III (Human Trials)\\nOnce the material has passed screening and usage tests in animals, it is ready for trials in humans. The reactions and performance under clinical conditions are studied.\\n# Therapeutic Effects of Dental Materials\\nCertain dental materials are utilized for their beneficial biological effects. For example, zinc oxide eugenol cement has a pain relieving effect on irritated pulp. Calcium hydroxide pulp capping agent promotes the formation of secondary dentin and helps repair dentinal tissue.\\n# Osseointegration',\n",
       " '# Osseointegration\\nThe osseointegration potential of titanium has been well-documented in the literature. It is this property which allowed the successful use of materials like titanium as an implant material. The surface of titanium forms a very thin layer of oxide which promotes osseointegration. Materials that allow osseointegration have a very low degradation rate. Osseointegration with intervening connective tissue is called fibrous osseointegration and is generally considered a failure. When the bone closely approximates the implant without intervening connective tissue, it is called osseointegration. If the bone actually fuses with the implant, it is called biointegration (refer chapter on Implants).\\n# Effect of Pressure on Tissues\\nIt was once believed that pressure from the pontic of a fixed dental prosthesis on the ridge resulted in permanent inflammation based on an article by Stein in 1966 (Pontic-residual ridge relationship: A research report, JPD 1966). With the increasing popularity of the ovate pontic it is now known that pressure results in remodelling of the tissues and does not invariably lead to permanent inflammation. Pressure from the pontic may result in short.\\n---\\nterm injury and inflammation as a result of tissue response to trauma. The tissues usually recover in 10 to 12 days. Porcelain restorations were relative uncommon prior to the 1960’s. Acrylic was commonly used for masking the metal for bridges and saddle pontics were widely used. Both saddle pontics and acrylic have been implicated in ridge inflammation and thus the inflammation reported by Stein may have been related to the pontic design or material (Figs. 5.7A and B).',\n",

Among the various materials polished or glazed, porcelain is the most inert. However, the pontic design must be taken into consideration.

Incorporating the disinfectant into the material as part of its composition.\\nImmersion in a disinfectant is the most common method of disinfection in the dental office as well as laboratory. However, certain materials like alginates may be affected if immersed beyond the recommended period. Alginates imbibe water and swell thereby affecting its accuracy.\\nCrowns, dentures, and other prostheses that have been tried in the mouth are also a possible source of contamination. After the try-in many of these are returned to the laboratory without disinfection. These contaminate the polishing lathe and the pumice powder used for polishing which in turn cross-contaminate other restorations and prostheses. Studies have shown complete dentures are massively contaminated with microorganisms and can serve as the primary source in the cycle of cross infection within dental laboratories. The polishing of dentures without previous disinfection leads to a high level of transfer of microorganisms. Infection control measures such as the use of barriers during polishing, the disinfection of dentures before being sent to the laboratory and upon return to the dental clinic, the disposal or sterilization of the cone after each use, as well as the addition of disinfectants to pumice and unit doses of pumice should be adopted with the objective of reducing the risk of cross-infection.\\n---\\n# Section-2\\n|Chapter 6|Introduction to Restorations, Luting and Pulp Therapy|73|\\n|---|---|---|\\n|Chapter 7|Cavity Liners and Varnish|80|\\n|Chapter 8|Dental Cements|84|\\n|Chapter 9|Dental Amalgam|128|',\n",

A restoration is a material which substitutes the missing tooth structure and restores the form and function of the tooth (\\n# TYPES OF RESTORATIONS\\n# TEMPORARY RESTORATIONS\\nTemporary restorations are often required before the placement of a permanent restoration. Materials used for temporary restorations are expected to last for only a short period of time, a few days or a few weeks.\\n---',\n",

However, it did not adapt well to the cavity walls, microleakage ensued and sensitivity was a common occurrence. Because of its excellent initial sealing ability and kind pulpal response, zinc oxide eugenol (ZOE) is the cement of choice for temporary restorations. This material is particularly useful when a sedative treatment is required until the pulp has healed well enough for the permanent restoration to be placed. The Type I ZOE is very popular for sedative treatment, temporary coverage and temporary cementation. Type III ZOE is used for temporary restorations.\\nIntermediate or holding type of restoration is particularly used in pedodontics. For example, in rampant caries, it is desirable to remove all the caries quickly in order to change the oral health and arrest the caries process. Once the initial ‘clean up’ has been done, the dentist can proceed with placement of the permanent restorations. The interval between removal of the caries and completion of final restorative work may take several months. During this time teeth are protected with a desirable intermediate restoration. Conventional zinc-eugenol cements used as temporary restorations are deficient in toughness. They have inadequate strength and abrasion resistance to serve for a longer period. As a result polymer reinforced cement (IRM) is used. Earlier Type II zinc phosphate and Type II or Type III zinc silicophosphate cements were used. However, these materials were irritating to the pulp and required more precise cavity preparation and placement time. They are now replaced by improved ZOE formulations. The combination of surface treatment and polymer reinforcement results in good strength, improved abrasion resistance and toughness. They can last for a period of one year or more.',\n",

However, it obviously serves to denote any material that is expected to last much longer than the temporary and intermediate restorations. Therefore, it is expected to have improved properties than the temporary and intermediate restorations. Examples of permanent restorative materials are direct filling gold, amalgam, composite resins, glass ionomer cement, as well as porcelain, composite and cast metal inlays and onlays. The length of time each material lasts varies on the technical skills of the operator, the material itself and other patient related factors. A well-made amalgam restoration would probably last a lifetime or more. On the other hand the composite restoration might have to be replaced much earlier as a result of wear, fracture or discoloration.\\n---\\n# Direct restorations\\nThese are materials used to build and restore the tooth structure directly in the mouth. They are usually placed in increments. They are usually soft and plastic when initially placed and harden later with time. Examples are amalgam, direct filling gold, composite (can be used both directly and indirectly) and glass ionomer.\\n# Indirect restorations\\nThese are usually fabricated outside the mouth on models of the tooth and then cemented into place in the mouth. Examples of indirect restorations are porcelain, composite and cast metal inlays and onlays.\\n# Esthetic and Nonesthetic\\nThe terms esthetic and nonesthetic are again relative.',\n",
       " '# Esthetic and Nonesthetic\\nThe terms esthetic and nonesthetic are again relative.\\nAn esthetic material is obviously something which is pleasing to an individual. At one time gold fillings and crowns were considered esthetic. Today, however, an esthetic material implies any material that is capable of reproducing the color and appearance of a natural tooth. Examples are resin-based composites, glass ionomer and porcelain restorations.\\nCurrently, it denotes any material that is not tooth colored. This includes amalgam, direct filling gold and metal inlays and onlays.\\n# Luting\\nLuting or cementation is the process by which crowns, restorations and other devices are fixed or attached to tooth structure using an intermediate material called cement. Cements have multiple uses. For example, glass ionomer can be used as a base, luting agent and as a restorative material. Besides attaching the restoration, a luting agent must also seal the space between the restoration and the tooth structure to prevent caries and chemical and bacterial irritation of the tooth and pulp.\\n# Temporary Cementation\\n---\\nA permanent cementing material on the other hand should be strong and insoluble in oral fluids. It would also be advantageous if it had some chemical bonding to the tooth structure. In addition, it should be fluid enough to flow well to ensure the complete seating of the restoration.

Prior to the discovery of pulp capping agents, a pulp exposure often led to irreversible pulpitis or pulpal infection and ultimately pulp necrosis. Thanks to these pulp capping agents, it became possible to treat pulpal tissue which otherwise would have had to undergo root canal therapy. Example of a pulp capping agent is calcium hydroxide cement.\\nAre all exposed pulps suitable for pulp capping therapy? The answer is obviously no. The dentist has to apply certain criteria and select his cases carefully.\\n1. The pulp should be healthy and noninfected.\\n---\\n# Following exposure the dentist should make all attempts to immediately isolate the tooth and prevent contamination.\\n# Types of Pulp Capping\\n# Direct Pulp Capping\\nThe excavation of deep carious lesions when the dentist accidentally exposes the pulp.',\n",

This is known as indirect pulp capping.\\nDeep carious lesions close to the pulp.\\nDuring excessive crown preparation the pulp is often visible through the remaining dentin as a pinkish or reddish spot or area.\\nSimilar near exposures may be seen in cases of traumatic tooth fracture.\\n# Bases\\nA base is a layer of cement placed beneath a permanent restoration to encourage recovery of the injured pulp and to protect it against numerous types of insults to which it may be subjected. The type of insults depends upon the particular restorative material. It may be thermal or chemical or galvanic. The base serves as replacement or substitute for the protective dentin, that has been destroyed by caries or cavity preparation.

       " 'Some important properties of cements used as high strengp bases are strengp, modulus of elasticity and permal conductivity.\\nLow strengp bases have minimum strengp and low rigidity. Their main function is to act as a barrier to irritating chemicals and to provide perapeutic benefit to pe pulp. Examples are: calcium hydroxide and zinc oxide eugenol.\\nThe base must provide thermal protection to the pulp. This property is important especially when the tooth is restored with metallic restorations.\\nThe thermal conductivity of most cement bases is similar to tooth structure and is in the range of recognized insulators such as cork and asbestos.\\nFor effective thermal protection the base should have minimal thickness of 0.75 mm. A thin wash of cement would not offer protection against thermal insults through metallic restorations.\\nThe cement base also serves as a barrier against penetration of irritating constituents (e.g. acids, monomer, etc.) from restorative materials. Calcium hydroxide and zinc oxide eugenol are most effective for this especially in deep (close to the pulp) cavities. Polycarboxylate and glass ionomer bases are also used as chemical barriers in more moderate cavities.\\nSome bases are used for their therapeutic benefit to the pulp. For example, calcium hydroxide acts as a pulp capping agent and promotes the formation of secondary dentin. Zinc oxide eugenol has an obtundent effect on the pulp.\\n- Withstand the forces of condensation. Fracture or displacement of the base permits the amalgam to penetrate the base and contact the dentin.

In case of direct filling gold where the condensation pressure is higher, a stronger cement is indicated as base.

Glass ionomer cement can also be used as base.\\n# LINERS AND VARNISH\\nLiners and varnishes are agents in a volatile solvent which when applied to a surface evaporates leaving behind a thin film.

They are generally materials of comparatively low strength, but have extensive use in dentistry. The first dental cement is said to have been introduced in 1785 by Sorel who created the ‘zinc-oxide-chloric-cement’. Nearly a hundred years later Rostain and then Fleck developed and introduced the zinc phosphate cement. Around the same period silicates were also developed. Cements have come a long way since then. Many of them have been improved considerably, while some like the silicate cements have been discontinued. Some like the glass ionomers and the polycarboxylate have adhesive properties and form a chemical bond to dentin and enamel. Regardless of some inferior properties, they possess so many desirable features that they are widely used in dentistry.\\n# CLASSIFICATION\\nCements have a wide variety of uses, properties and reaction mechanisms.

Some of the minimum requirements for water-based dental cements are presented in Table 8.1.\\n# Net Setting Time\\nNet setting time is the period of time, measured from the end of mixing, until the material has set (as per ISO criteria).\\n# Strength\\nMost cements are comparatively weak when compared to restorative materials like amalgam and composites. The strength required depends on the application. For example, a cement used as a base under amalgam should have sufficient strength to withstand condensation forces. Many dental cements as well as restorative materials continue to gain strength with time. For this reason, patients are often advised to wait at least 2 hours before any food is placed in the mouth. In addition, the side in which the restoration has been placed is avoided for a further 24-hour period.\\n# Modulus of Elasticity (MOE)\\nThis is a measure of the stiffness of the cement. Cements under ceramic crowns should have sufficient stiffness to withstand masticatory loads. A low MOE can result in flexing of the restoration resulting in fracture.\\n# Solubility and Disintegration',\n",
       " '# Solubility and Disintegration\\nThis is an important property as it can determine the long-term survivability of restorations. Solubility and disintegration of the cement at the margins can eventually lead to problems like inflammation, caries, sensitivity, etc. Most cements exhibit varying degrees of solubility. ISO specification No. 99171:2007 uses in vitro testing with 0.1 mol/L lactic acid with a pH of 2.74. However, a more reliable test would be an in vivo test as conditions in the mouth are far more complex. Solubility and disintegration can be reduced by proper manipulation, minimizing the exposure of the cement to the oral environment and protecting the cement during setting and the initial 24-hour period.\\n# Film Thickness\\nFilm thickness is an important property especially for luting cements. A thinner film is more advantageous for luting.\\n---\\n# 1\\nOne cannot rely entirely on the cement for sealing an open margin.

Thus it is important that the cement should not be irritant or toxic to the pulp.\\nPH of the cement Most cements are acidic. The exceptions are zinc oxide eugenol, calcium hydroxide and resin cements. The acidity of cements is higher at the time of placement but gradually decrease with time.\\nPulpal response The pulp response may be classified as mild, moderate or severe. Originally silicate cement was used as a reference to compare the pulpal response to various cements. Because of its high acidity, silicates were classed as severe irritant. High acidity can irritate and sometimes lead to irreversible pulpal damage. In some patients it can cause severe pain and sensitivity. Monomer present in resin-based cements is also a potential irritant.\\nPulp protection In case of deep cavities and where the cement is classed as an irritant measures to protect the pulp are indicated.\\n1. Avoid thin mixes.\\n2. Pulp protection should be carried out in deep cavities through the use of an intervening liner or base.\\n---\\nCements manufactured for various applications would have been modified slightly to suit the particular application. For example, glass ionomer manufactured for luting may be slightly different from glass ionomer used for restorations. Luting cements are usually more fine-grained and have a different powder-liquid ratio. Restorative GIC has better translucency and esthetics when compared to the luting GIC which may be more opaque.\\nMany cements contain fluoride which is gradually released over a period of time to impart adjacent teep structure wip caries resistance. Glass ionomer is an example of a fluoride releasing cement.\\nFluoride recharging: The process by which a restorative material, specifically glass ionomer cement, absorbs fluoride from a solution with a high fluoride concentration.\\n# SILICATE CEMENTS',\n",
       " 'Fluoride recharging: The process by which a restorative material, specifically glass ionomer cement, absorbs fluoride from a solution with a high fluoride concentration.\\n# SILICATE CEMENTS\\nSilicate cements are said to have been introduced in 1873 by Fletcher as an anterior esthetic filling material. They were translucent and resembled porcelain in appearance. Though the initial esthetics was satisfactory, over a period of time silicates degraded and stained. Leakage around the margins result in dark margins. Silicates are attacked by oral fluids and in time degrade. The average life of a silicate restoration is four years. Some may last as long as 25 years, others may require replacement in a year or even less.\\n3 Silicate cement.\\nThe incidence of secondary caries is markedly less around silicate restorations. This is surprising when considering that severe leakage takes place at its margins. Also, the incidence of contact caries is less when compared to amalgam restorations (contact caries is the term applied to caries occurring on the proximal surface of the tooth adjacent to the restoration). The anticariogenic property is due to the presence of 15% fluoride. Fluoride release is slow and occurs throughout the life of the restoration. Silicate cements were classed as a severe irritant to the pulp because of its low pH (acidic). For many years silicate served as a standard for comparing the pulpal response to other material. In deep cavities, the pulp had to be protected with varnish or calcium hydroxide.\\nWith the development of better alternate materials like composite resin and glass ionomer cements, silicates gradually fell out of favor. By the 1980s and 1990s, they were gradually phased out of the market and are rarely used. However, silicate cements are of historical interest as they were the first tooth-colored filling materials. It also forms the basis for the glass ionomer system.\\n# ZINC PHOSPHATE CEMENT',\n",

This is beneficial when it is used to cement restorations that are subjected to high masticatory stresses.\\nThis property is important for cements used for permanent cementation. When tested according to ISO specification, maximum solubility permitted is 0.3 (Table 8.1).\\nHowever, in the mouth they show greater disintegration over a period of time. This shows that other factors are involved (like wear, abrasion, chemical attacks by products from decaying food, etc.). The solubility is greater in dilute organic acids like lactic, acetic and especially citric acids, all of which are present in the human diet.

Two traditional formulations—Rickert’s formula and Grossman’s formula are very popular. Along with gutta-percha, these materials are used in endodontic therapy to seal the canals. Some materials are used as therapeutic sealers and are formulated with ingredients such as iodoform, paraformaldehyde or trioxymethylene which have therapeutic value. Others contain antibiotics such as tetracyclines and steroids as anti-inflammatory agents. Some formulations can also be used for pulp capping. Endodontic sealers also contain radiopaque materials such as barium sulphate, bismuth salts or silver powder.

Shear bond strength ranges from 3–5 MPa.\\nMechanism of adhesion: Glass ionomer bonds chemically to tooth structure. The exact mechanism has not been fully understood. The bonding is due to the reaction between the carboxyl groups of the polyacids and the calcium in the enamel and dentin. The bond to enamel is always higher than that to dentin, probably due to the greater inorganic content of enamel and its greater homogeneity.\\n# Esthetics\\nEsthetically they are inferior to silicates and composites. They lack translucency and have a rough surface texture. They may stain with time. The restorative GICs are available in different shades. The esthetics are sufficient for restoring cervical lesions and minor defects in nonesthetic zones. The luting cement is more opaque than the restorative cement.\\n# Biocompatibility\\nPulpal response to GIC is classified as mild.\\nType II glass ionomers are relatively biocompatible. The pulpal reaction is greater than that from zinc oxide eugenol cements but less than that produced by zinc phosphate cement. Polyacids are relatively weak acids.

Thus the fissure orifice in general must exceed 100 um in width. Fissures or pits that are smaller are better treated with acid etching and light cured resin sealants. The use of glass ionomer in sealant therapy will increase as formulations are developed that are less viscous (e.g. light cured) and have good wear resistance.\\nMetal-reinforced glass ionomer cements were first introduced in 1977 to improve the strength, fracture toughness and resistance to wear and yet maintain the potential for adhesion and anticariogenic property. The addition of silver-amalgam alloy powder to conventional materials also provided radiodensity. Subsequently, silver particles were sintered onto the glass and a new product called cermet was launched.

The clinical performance of cermet cements is considered to be inferior to other restorative materials, so much so that their use is now discouraged.\\nBoth metal modified ionomers have anticariogenic capability due to leaching of fluoride. However, less fluoride is released from Cermet cement than restorative GIC, since the glass particle is metal coated. On the other hand, the admixed cement releases more fluoride than restorative GIC. Here the metal filler particles are not bonded to the cement matrix and thus there are pathways for fluid exchange. This increases leaching of fluoride.\\nThese materials are gray in color because of metallic phases within them; therefore, they are unsuitable for use in anterior teeth.\\n# RESIN-MODIFIED GLASS IONOMER\\n# CLASSIFICATION\\nDepending on which is the predominant component.

Development of resin cements came naturally with the development of composites resins. They are essentially low viscosity flowable composites. These cements are known for their high esthetics and high bond strengths. They were widely used for the cementation of orthodontic brackets and resin-bonded restorations. The development of esthetic all-ceramic restorations led to a renewed interest in an esthetic bonding system which complemented the esthetics of the restoration. The color of the underlying cement can influence the esthetics in translucent restorations. The resin cement also improves the esthetics at the margins of the restoration.

The process is carried out in an electrolytic bath containing an acid like sulfuric acid—also known as electrochemical etching. The non-bonding surface is protected with wax. Silica coating can also be used to improve bonding.\\nEtching porcelain: Ceramic is a highly inert material and is immune to attack by most acids.

Removal of excess cement can sometimes be very difficult because of the high strength of the material. Therefore, removal of the excess cement should be attempted soon after seating before the material has fully hardened. Some manufacturers recommend a partial light cure to facilitate removal followed by completion of curing.\\nShortly after the introduction of RM GICs, ‘compomers’ were introduced to the market. They were marketed as a new class of dental materials that would provide the combined benefits of composites (the ‘comp’ in their name) and glass ionomers (‘omer’). These materials had the fluoride release features of GIC with the durability of composite. Based on their structure and properties, these materials belong to the class of dental composites. Often they have been erroneously referred to as ‘hybrid glass ionomers’, ‘light-cured GICs’ or ‘resin-modified glass ionomers’.

The disadvantage is their lack of adhesion. Thus bonding agents are required which increase in the number of steps and time required for placement. Constant reformulations of these types of materials may eventually make them comparable or even superior to existing composites, but as long as they do not set via an acid-base reaction and do not bond to hard-tooth tissues, they cannot and should not be classified with GICs.\\n---\\n# Chapter 9: Dental Amalgam\\n# Chapter Outline\\n- History of Dental Amalgam\\n- Microstructure of Set Single-composition Amalgam\\n- Cavity Design\\n- Indications\\n- Contraindications\\n- Classification of Amalgam\\n- Manufacture\\n- Composition\\n- Comparison of Lathe Cut and Spherical Alloys\\n- Low Copper Alloys\\n- Composition\\n- Available As\\n- Setting Reaction\\n- Microstructure\\n- Advantages/Disadvantages of Admixed Amalgam\\n- Single-composition Alloys\\n- Composition\\n- Setting Reaction\\nAn amalgam is defined as a special type of alloy in which mercury is one of the components. Mercury is able to react with certain alloys to form a plastic mass, which is conveniently packed into a prepared cavity in a tooth. This plastic mass hardens and is stronger than any dental cement or anterior filling material. Dental amalgam is the most widely used filling material for posterior teeth.\\nThe alloys before combining with mercury are known as dental amalgam alloys. Strictly speaking, however, this is a misnomer as they are not dental amalgam alloys but alloys from which dental amalgam is prepared.',\n",
       " 'In dentistry, amalgam has been successfully used for more than a century as a restoration material for tooth decay. Over the years its quality has greatly improved, thanks to a lower amount of mercury and the addition of new components which can reduce its corrosion in the oral cavity.\\n---\\n# History of Dental Amalgam\\nThere are indications that dental amalgam was used in the first part of the T’ang Dynasty in China (618-907 CE). Prior to amalgam, dentists restored teeth using filling material such as stone chips, resin, cork, turpentine, gum, lead and gold leaf, among other metals. The renowned physician Ambroise Paré (1510–1590) used lead or cork to fill teeth.\\nIn 1603, a German named Tobias Dorn Kreilius described a process for creating an amalgam filling by dissolving copper sulfide with strong acids, adding mercury, bringing to a boil and then pouring onto the teeth. In France, D’Arcet’s Mineral Cement was popular, but it had to be boiled into a liquid before being poured on patient’s teeth. Louis Regnart added mercury to the mixture, lowering the temperature required significantly, and for this became known as the ‘Father of Amalgam’.\\nAmalgam was placed by Taveau of Paris as early as 1826, although he had developed it in 1816. Early amalgam had drawbacks including marginal breakdown. Some mixtures caused expansion resulting in fractured teeth.\\nIn the 1830s, a fusible alloy of lead, bismuth and tin, known as “Darcet’s metal” was used to fill teeth. This material was heated and then poured into the tooth in the molten state, after which it quickly hardened.',\n",
       " 'Amalgam was introduced into the USA by the Crawcour brothers (from France) in 1833. However, at that point the use of dental amalgam was declared to be malpractice, and the American Society of Dental Surgeons (ASDS), the only US dental association at the time, forced all of its members to sign a pledge to abstain from using the mercury fillings. This was the beginning of what are known as the first dental amalgam war. The war ended in 1856 with the rescission of the old association. The American Dental Association was founded in its place in 1859, which has since then strongly defended dental amalgam from allegations of being too risky from the health standpoint.\\nEarly amalgam was made by mixing mercury with the filings of silver coins. The early amalgams expanded on setting. In 1895, GV Black developed a balanced formula (67% silver, 27% tin, 5% copper, 1% zinc) for modern amalgam alloy. Black’s formula overcame the expansion problems of the existing amalgam formulations.\\n# Indications\\n|1.|As a permanent filling material for|\\n|---|---|\\n| |- Class I and class II cavities (| |- Class V cavities where esthetics is not required (|2.|In combination with retentive pins to restore a crown.|\\n|3.|For making dies.|\\n|4.|In retrograde root canal fillings.|\\n|5.|As a core material in abutment teeth.|\\n# Contraindications\\n|1.|Amalgam should not be placed in patients with impaired kidney function.|\\n|---|---|\\n|2.|Individuals with allergic hypersensitivity to mercury or components of the alloy.|\\n|3.|New amalgam fillings should not be placed in contact with nonamalgam restoration like gold and metal devices, such as orthodontic braces.|\\n1 Amalgam restorations—Class I, class II and class V.\\n---\\n# Box 9.1 ISO standards covering dental amalgam and related products and equipment\\n|ISO 24234:2015|Dentistry—Mercury and alloys for dental amalgam|\\n|---|---|\\n|ISO 7488:1991|Dental amalgamators|\\n|ISO 8282:1994|Dental equipment—Mercury and alloy mixers and dispensers|',\n",

The stresses induced during the cutting and grinding process must be relieved by an annealing process (100 °C for several hours).

Dental amalgam has an exceptionally fine record of clinical performance because of its tendency to minimize marginal leakage (see tarnish and corrosion).',\n",
       " 'The small amount of leakage under amalgam restorations is unique. If the restoration is properly inserted, leakage decreases as the restoration ages in the mouth. This may be due to the formation of corrosion products in the tooth-restoration interface. Over a period of time they seal the interface and reduce leakage. Thus amalgam is a self-sealing restoration. Both low and high copper amalgams are capable of sealing against microleakage but the accumulation of corrosion products is slower with the high-copper alloys. Initial leakage can be reduced through the application of varnish on the cavity walls. Use of dentin bonding agents (bonded amalgam technique) also show promise.\\nThe earliest amalgams exhibited expansion while setting. This was because of the greater mercury/alloy ratio used. Amalgams may expand or contract, depending on its manipulation. Ideally, dimensional change should be small. Excessive contraction can lead to microleakage, sensitivity, and secondary caries. Excessive expansion can produce pressure on the pulp and postoperative sensitivity. Protrusion of the restoration can also occur.\\nISO Sp. 24234:2015 requires that amalgam should not expand more than 0.15% or contract less than –0.1% at 37 °C, during hardening. Mechanically, triturated modern amalgams, both low and high copper, prepared from low mercury/alloy ratios show a slight contraction.\\nWhen the alloy and mercury are mixed contraction results initially as the particles dissolve and the γ1 grows. The final volume of γ1 is less than the initial volumes of silver and mercury that go into making the γ. Therefore, contraction will continue as long as growth of γ1 continues.',\n",
       " 'The γ1 crystals as they grow, impinge against one another, and produce an outward pressure tending to oppose contraction. If there is sufficient mercury present to provide a plastic matrix, an expansion will occur when γ1 crystals impinge on each other. After a rigid γ1 matrix has formed, growth of γ1 crystals cannot force the matrix to expand. Instead γ1 crystals will grow into interstices containing mercury, consuming mercury.\\n# Advantages\\n- Higher compressive strength.\\n- Higher tensile strength.\\n- Higher modulus of elasticity.\\n- Higher resistance to creep.\\n- Lower creep during condensation.\\n- Faster finishing.\\n- Higher early strength.\\n- Low condensation pressure.\\n# Disadvantages\\n- Less working time.\\n- Condensation pressure not sufficient to displace matrix during condensation (while restoring proximal cavities).

Modern amalgams are mixed with high-speed amalgamators (equivalent to an increase in trituration time).\\nIf a zinc-containing-low-copper or high-copper amalgam is contaminated by moisture during trituration or condensation, a large expansion can take place. It usually starts after 3-5 days and may continue for months, reaching values greater than 400 μm (4%). This is known as delayed expansion or secondary expansion ( The expansion is caused by the releases of hydrogen gas from the reaction of zinc with water.',\n",
       " 'This hydrogen gas does not combine with the amalgam, but collects within the restoration, creating extreme internal pressure and expansion of the mass. This causes protrusion of the restoration out of the cavity, increased creep, increased microleakage, pitted surfaces, and corrosion. Dental pain, recurrence of caries, and fracture of the restoration are seen as a result of these poorly inserted restorations.\\nNote: Moisture contamination after the cavity has been filled does not cause delayed expansion. Nonzinc alloys do not show this type of expansion when contaminated with water. However, moisture contamination of the mix of any alloy results in inferior physical properties.\\nAmalgam without zinc tends to be less plastic and less workable. These alloys are used only for cases where it is difficult to control moisture, e.g. patients having excessive salivation, retrograde root canal filling, subgingival lesions, etc.\\nWell-designed amalgam restorations have sufficient compressive strength to withstand normal intraoral masticatory forces.\\n---\\n|Compressive strength|Hour|7 Days|\\n|---|---|---|\\n|Low copper (lathe cut)|45 MPa|302 MPa|\\n|Low copper (spherical)|141 MPa|366 MPa|\\n|Admixed|137 MPa|431 MPa|\\n|Single composition|262 MPa|510 MPa|\\nAmalgam cannot withstand high tensile or bending stresses and can fracture easily in improperly designed restorations ( Therefore, the cavity should be designed so that the restoration will receive minimal tension or shear forces in service.\\n| |Low Copper|Admixed|Single composition|\\n|---|---|---|---|\\n| |60 MPa|48 MPa|64 MPa|',\n",

After 20 minutes, compressive strength may be only 6% of the one week strength. ISO specifications stipulate a minimum of 100 MPa at one hour and 350 MPa after 24 hours. Since the initial strength of amalgam is low, patients should be cautioned not to bite too hard for at least 8 hours after placement, the time at which at least 70% of its strength is gained. The one hour compressive strength of high-copper single-composition amalgams is exceptionally high (262 MPa), so the chances of accidental fracture are less.\\nEven after six months, some amalgams may still be increasing in strength, suggesting that the reactions between the matrix phases and the alloy particles may continue indefinitely.\\nClinical significance: The rate of hardening should be considered during the placement of amalgam. In class II restorations where a supporting matrix has been placed, removal of the matrix should be done at the appropriate time. Early removal can result in fracture. Excessive pressure on the restoration by the patient prematurely to test the occlusion can also result in fracture.\\nEffect of trituration: Either undertrituration or overtrituration will decrease the strength for both low-copper and high-copper amalgams.\\n12: A fractured amalgam restoration. Amalgam is technique sensitive. If improperly placed, it can result in many problems including fracture, leakage, sensitivity, periodontal problems, etc.\\n13: Amalgam with high creep rate displaying marginal breakdown.\\n---\\nSufficient mercury should be mixed with the alloy to wet each particle of the alloy.

Increased creep rate is shown by larger γ1 volume fractions. Decreased creep rate is shown by larger γ1 grain sizes. The γ2 phase is associated with higher creep rates.

Retention of the amalgam filling is obtained through mechanical locking. This is achieved by proper cavity design (see cavity design in technical considerations). Additional retention if needed can be obtained by placing pins within the cavity. Amalgam can also be bonded using special bonding agents.\\nAmalgam restorations often tarnish and corrode in the mouth. Black silver sulfide can form on the surface of an amalgam restoration in some patients. Both high and low-copper amalgams show corrosion.

(Oral lichenoid reaction).\\n---\\nMercury is toxic to the human body and to the environment. Fortunately risk to the patient of mercury exposure from dental restorations is very low even with multiple restorations (Boxes 9.3 and 9.5). However, mercury vapors pose a greater risk to the dental personnel as they are more easily inhaled and absorbed through the lungs. Mercury vapors may be produced during trituration and condensation of amalgam and removal of old restorations. Further information is under the section mercury toxicity at the end of the chapter.',\n",
       " 'Contact reactions occurring from proximity or contact with amalgam are rare. The symptoms are normally classified as delayed hypersensitivity reactions (type IV), and they were called oral lichenoid reactions (OLRs) by Finne et al. These are lesions that clinically and histologically resemble lichen planus ( These reactions are presumably due to allergic or toxic reactions to compounds released or generated from the restoration. It is recommended that patch tests should be performed in patients with OLR if the lesions are in close contact with amalgam fillings. Replacement of such restorations is recommended if there is a positive patch test reaction to mercury or components of amalgam and if there are no signs of concomitant generalized lichen planus.\\n# Technical Considerations\\nThe clinical success of amalgam restorations is highly dependent on the correct cavity design and selection and manipulation of the alloy. If a restoration is defective, it is usually the fault of the operator and not the material.\\nProviding retention Since amalgam does not adhere to tooth structure, proper design of the cavity is very important. The amalgam cavity is designed to provide maximum mechanical locking of the amalgam ( This is achieved by creating a cavity with walls that diverge towards the floor of the cavity (or converge towards the mouth of the cavity). This results in a cavity mouth that is narrower, effectively locking the amalgam within the cavity. Additional retention if needed can be obtained by placing pins within the cavity.\\n|Box 9.3|Current position on safety of dental amalgams|\\n|---|---|',\n",

However, there is a small percentage of the population which is hypersensitive to mercury and can suffer health effects from even a low exposure. A total ban on amalgam is not considered justified. Neither is the removal of sound amalgam fillings in patients who have no indication of adverse health effects attributable to mercury exposure. As recently as May 2005, the ADA endorsed amalgam as being safe for pregnant women. As a general principle, it is advisable to reduce human exposure to heavy metals in the environment, even if there is no clinical evidence of adverse health effects, provided the reduction can be achieved by other materials at reasonable cost and without introducing other adverse effects.| |\\n---\\n# 15\\nThe cavity walls are designed to lock the amalgam restoration. This is achieved by creating walls that taper, effectively making the mouth of the cavity narrower than the base.\\n# Four wall support\\nFor effective condensation, the cavity should have four walls and a floor. If one or more of the walls of the cavity is absent, a stainless steel matrix can compensate for the missing walls. Failure to have a four wall support can result in inadequate condensation which can weaken the amalgam. Additional retention can be obtained with amalgam pins or screws.\\n# Preventing tensile fracture\\nSince amalgam has poor tensile strength, the cavity should have sufficient depth and width in order to provide sufficient bulk to the amalgam, especially those in high-stress areas.\\n# Cavosurface angle\\nThe junction of the cavity with the external surface should be as close to a right angle as possible.

Final smoothing can be done by rubbing the surface with a moist cotton pellet.\\n# Polishing',\n",
       " '# Polishing\\nPolishing minimizes corrosion and prevents adherence of plaque. The polishing should be delayed for at least 24 hours after condensation, or preferably longer. Wet polishing is advised, so a wet abrasive powder in a paste form is used. Dry polishing powders can raise the temperature above 60°C. If the temperature rises above 60°C, mercury is released which may cause corrosion and fracture at the margins. High copper unicompositional alloys with high early strength may be polished at the same sitting after the materials has hardened sufficiently. However, polishing should be carried out delicately using soft abrasives and gentle pressure. A completed amalgam restoration is shown in 31.\\nAmalgam restorations do not reinforce the teeth. Teeth with MOD cavities are susceptible to cuspal fractures. Bonding of the amalgam with a suitable adhesive (4-META) has been shown to improve fracture resistance of the tooth (twice as much as nonbonded restorations). Amalgam bonding also reduces marginal leakage and postoperative sensitive. The bonding mechanism is similar to that of resin bonding agents. The bonding agent penetrates the dentinal tubules and forms a hybrid zone. The bond with the amalgam is micromechanical through the formation of resin tags when amalgam is condensed into the uncured bonding agent. However, amalgam to amalgam bond is not so effective and therefore repair with bonding agents is not recommended. A variety of amalgam bonding agents are available commercially (\\n---\\nMercury is toxic to living creatures. Free mercury should not be sprayed or exposed to the atmosphere.

Studies have often been taken out of context resulting in considerable alarm among the general public. Some of these controversies have been created by dentists themselves. It is of the uppermost importance that people be correctly informed on the position taken by the international scientific community and the leading health care agencies with respect to the potential risk of amalgam. The following reports have justified the continued use of amalgam.\\n---\\nIn the US, the Assistant Secretary for Health established in 1991, a research committee with the aim of carefully reviewing nearly 500 scientific publications on amalgam. The study, which appeared in 1995, failed to show any harmfulness for the amalgam fillings.\\nFollowing the advice of the General Surgeon and the Center for Disease Control and Prevention of the Food and Drug Administration, the US Public Health Service recently published an article in a magazine with a very high circulation. The purpose was to clarify the issue and reassure the American people, who had been alarmed by the many news reports on the amalgam risk.',\n",
       " 'In Switzerland, Chairmen from the four Dental Departments at Universities of Berne, Basel, Geneva and Zurich replied to the alleged charges of amalgam-induced damages which appeared on newspapers and nonscientific journals with a review article. Amalgam was judged as a safe and effective material for posterior tooth filling, with the only exception of allergic patients.\\nAt two meetings of the Federation Dentaire Internationale held in 1994 in Vancouver and Budapest, amalgam was acquitted on the charge of toxicity and was judged as a valid, cheap and still irreplaceable material.\\nIn 1995, a joint statement from the World Health Organization (through two of its agencies, the Oral Health Program and the Office for Global and Integrated Environmental Health, and from the FDA, amalgam fillings were considered to be safe and inexpensive, although their color was different from that of natural teeth. For environmental reasons, the document also reported, there could be in the future some limitation to the use of amalgam. Unfortunately, such restrictions were misinterpreted by the mass media, causing unjustified fears in the public opinion and a rising demand for substitution of the restorations.\\nEver since the first environmentalist protests against the use of amalgam, a research center was created in Germany by the University Departments of Münster and Erlangen. After reviewing several scientific papers and following hundreds of patients, including 200 pregnant women, the center concluded that: (i) no harmful effects from amalgam had been found in both the general population and the newborns; (ii) high plasma levels of mercury had been found as a consequence of elevated fish consumption.',\n",
       " 'After careful studies, the Swedish Medical Research Council concluded that all restoration materials currently in use, including amalgam and composite resins, are safe and effective. Nevertheless the Swedish government, through the Department of Environment, recently issued a series of rules to limit the use of amalgam for filling purposes. The main argument was based on an ecological ground, as it was estimated that between 40 and 60 tons of amalgam are carried in the mouth of Swedish people. It was feared that, as a consequence of crematory habits, mercury would be massively released in the environment. In Sweden alone, nearly 300 kilograms of mercury are estimated to be dispersed in the atmosphere, and between 200 and 400 kilograms in the water mains, every year.\\nThere is no question about the fact that the international dental community has been strongly reducing the use of amalgam for filling carious teeth; the main reason, however, has been an esthetic demand from patients rather than a toxicological need. Not unexpectedly, most colleagues from all over the world have kept using amalgam in their own or their offspring’s mouth, whenever needed.\\nAs reported in the literature, a certain number of patophobic or easily influenced patients still prefer to have restorations with materials other than amalgam, even after receiving all possible information. Their demands should be satisfied as long as this decision may have a placebo effect; however, these patients should be discouraged from having their still perfect amalgam restorations substituted by other materials. In fact removal of these restorations pose a bigger risk of releasing mercury into the environment.\\nAs a useful reminder to the student, the best filling is the one that has never been applied; the most effective therapy is prevention.\\n---\\n# Chapter 10\\n# Direct Filling Gold\\n# Chapter Outline\\n- Applications\\n- Contraindications\\n- Mat Foil\\n- Alloyed Electrolytic\\n- Hand Mallet Condensers',\n",

The use of gold foil in modern dentistry starts around 1400 in renaissance Italy. Its use is described in a medical text written in 1425 by Giovanni Arcolani (Johannas D’Arcola) a professor of the University of Bologna. Robert Woofendale is credited to have introduced it to the USA in 1766 on his arrival from England. However, its use became widespread in the USA only towards the beginning of the 19th century.\\nIt is the most noble of metals and rarely tarnishes in the oral cavity. Gold in its pure form is very soft (25 BHN). Its malleability and lack of a surface oxide layer permit increments to be welded together. This unique characteristic of gold to be welded at room temperature (cold-welded), allows gold to be used as a direct filling material.\\nAlthough the dental profession sometimes refers to all direct filling golds (DFGs) as ‘Gold Foils’ the present products may be divided into three categories. All are of 99.99% or higher purity, except two (Platinized foil and Electraloy RV).\\nCurrently, direct filling gold is not as widely used as it once was. However, it will continue to be described because it is still used and is an excellent restorative material when placed properly.\\nAn example of gold foil marketed in the early 1900s.\\n---\\n# APPLICATIONS\\n|1.|Pits and small class I restorations (2).|\\n|---|---|\\n|2.|For repair of casting margins.|\\n|3.|For class II, class V and class VI restorations (3).|\\n|4.|Repair of cement vent holes and perforations in gold crowns (Figs. 10.4A to C).|\\n# CONTRAINDICATIONS',\n",

It was manufactured for dental applications as early as 1812 by Marcus Bull (USA). It is manufactured by beating gold into sheets.\\nGold is malleable. A cast ingot of 15 mm thickness is beaten to a submicroscopic thickness of 15 or 25 μm. The product is called gold foil (Figs. 10.5A and B). The crystals of the original cast metal are deformed and elongated so that they have a fibrous structure, hence it is also known as fibrous gold.\\n1.

Preformed cylinders and ropes. These are made by cutting the No. 4 gold foil sheets into strips of varying widths (3.2, 4.8, etc.) and then rolling and compressing them into pellets or cylinders. They may be ‘carbonized’.\\n3. A number of sheets of foil may be placed one top of each other to form laminated gold foil. One type of laminated foil is the platinized foil, which is a sheet of pure platinum foil sandwiched between two sheets of pure gold foil.\\n---\\nCarbonized or corrugated gold Rolling into a pellet or cylinder form is convenient for carrying and compacting into cavities. Many dentists cut and roll their own gold. Preformed gold foil in the form of ropes and cylinders may be available in ‘carbonized’ or ‘corrugated’ form (made from No. 4 foil that has been ‘carbonized’ or ‘corrugated’). This form of gold foil is of historical interest because it was an outcome of the great Chicago fire in 1871. Corrugated foil is obtained by placing the gold foil in between sheets of paper and igniting it in a closed container. On igniting, the paper gets charred, but the gold foil is left unharmed except that it becomes ‘corrugated’. This is because of the shriveling of the paper while oxidizing in the airtight safe. After the carbon is removed it is found that the gold exhibits superior welding property.\\nPlatinized foil This is a laminated foil in which pure platinum foil is sandwiched between two sheets of No. 4 gold foil. The sheets are beaten and joined together. Platinum is added to gold foil to increase the hardness of the restoration. This product is available only in No. 4 sheet form.\\nCohesive and noncohesive gold In practice only the sheet foil is furnished in both conditions, though all forms of direct filling gold could be supplied in cohesive and noncohesive form.',\n",
       " 'Cohesive and noncohesive gold In practice only the sheet foil is furnished in both conditions, though all forms of direct filling gold could be supplied in cohesive and noncohesive form.\\nNoncohesive The earliest gold foils were ‘noncohesive’ in nature. The manufacturer subjects the foil to a volatile agent such as ammonia, which is absorbed on the surface of the gold. Ammonia-treated foil is called noncohesive foil. This adsorption of ammonia gas onto the surface of the gold prevents the gold foil from adhering if it folds back on itself, or contacts other pieces of foil. This is also useful when pellets or cylinders are packed together in containers. It prevents premature cohesion of pellets in their container. It also protects the surface of the gold from contamination which can’t be removed. This treatment enables the user of the foil to handle it with a little more ease. Noncohesive gold can also have adsorbed agents like iron salt or an acidic gas (sulfur or phosphorous containing groups) on its surface. The volatile film is readily removed by heating (see annealing), thereby restoring the cohesive character of the foil. Noncohesive gold is rarely used currently, but may be used to build up the bulk of a direct gold restoration. Disadvantage of noncohesive gold Because the gold wouldn’t stick to itself one could not build contour above the cavosurface. Fillings were pretty much flat from cavosurface to cavosurface.\\nElectrolytic Precipitate Crystalline gold powder is formed by electrolytic precipitation. The powder has a dendritic crystalline structure. The powder is formed into shapes or strips by sintering (heat fusion) at high temperatures but below their melting point. The particles coalesce or join together at this temperature.\\n---',\n",
       " '---\\nMat gold is electrolytically precipitated gold sandwiched between sheets of foil and pen formed into strips. The strips can be cut by pe dentist into pe desired size. Mat gold is used to buildup pe bulk of pe restoration, as it can be more easily compacted and adapted to pe cavity. However, mat gold has lots of voids and results in a pitted external surface. Therefore, foil gold is used to cover pe mat gold and form pe surface of pe restoration.\\nIt is a sandwich of electrolytic precipitated gold powder between sheets of No. 3 gold foil. The sandwich is sintered and cut into strips of differing widps. The dentist can pen cut pese to pe desired lengps. Sandwiching mat between foil sheets was done to try to eliminate pe need to veneer pe restoration wip a layer of foil. This type is no longer marketed.\\nA form of electrolytic gold is an alloy of gold and calcium (0.1% by wt.) called ‘Electraloy RV’. For greater ease of handling, pe alloy is sandwiched between two layers of gold foil. Calcium produces stronger restorations by dispersion strengpening, which locks in cold work strengpening. Thus, alloying wip calcium changes pe crystalline structure and makes it harder and stronger.\\n|Synonym|Granular gold|\\n|---|---|\\n|Since the 19th century, chemically precipitated gold powders have been available in agglomerated form with a liquid such as alcohol or dilute carbolic acid, which held the agglomerate together. The agglomerates usually disintegrated when compaction was attempted, so the gold powder was mixed with a wax binder and enclosed in a No. 3 gold foil. This form was first marketed commercially in the 1960s as ‘Goldent’ (Morgan Hastings Co.) (Figs. 10.6A and B). In the 1980s another brand ‘EZ Gold’ (Ivoclar North America) was introduced.| |',\n",
       " 'A fine powder is formed by chemical precipitation or by atomizing pe metal. The particle sizes vary (average 15 μm). The pellets are mixed wip soft wax (0.01% organic wax, which is burnt off prior to use) and pen wrapped wip gold foil (No. 3), raper pan sintering pe mass, like for mat gold.\\nThe powdered gold pellets have a cylindrical or irregular shape and a diameter of 1 to 2 mm. The ratio of gold foil to powder varies from 1 to 3 for pe smallest pellets to approximately 1 to 9 for pe largest.\\n---\\nThe foil acts as an effective container and matrix for the powdered metal, while it is condensed. Some operators believe that the use of powdered gold pellets increases cohesion during compaction and reduces the time required for placing the restoration. This is because each pellet contains 10 times more metal by volume than comparable sized pellet of gold foil.\\n- Desorbing\\n- Compaction\\n- Finishing\\nThe direct filling golds are received by the dentist in a cohesive condition, except for the noncohesive golds. However, during storage and packaging, they absorb gases from the atmosphere. Adsorbed gases prevent gold from fusing. Hence, it is necessary for the dentist to heat the foil or pellet immediately before it is carried into the prepared cavity. This heating process which removes surface gases (oxygen, nitrogen, ammonia, moisture or sulfur dioxide) and ensures a clean surface is called desorbing or degassing (rather than annealing). Storage in airtight containers is advised and the operator should wear chamois finger-tips to protect the gold from contamination. A totally dry cavity is essential throughout the compaction process in order to allow complete cohesion.\\n- In bulk on a tray by gas flame or electricity\\n- Piece by piece, in a well-adjusted alcohol flame',\n",
       " '- In bulk on a tray by gas flame or electricity\\n- Piece by piece, in a well-adjusted alcohol flame\\nIn practice, all but powder gold may be desorbed on a tray. Powder gold must be heated in a flame to ensure the complete burning away of the wax. Precaution during bulk heating: Excessive amounts should be avoided, since the difficulties arising from prolonged heating can arise from repeated heating as well. Care should be taken to handle pieces with stainless steel wire points or similar instruments that will not contaminate the gold.\\nThe electric ‘annealer’ is maintained at a temperature between 340 °C and 370 °C. The time required varies from 5 to 20 minutes depending on the temperature and the quantity of gold on the tray.\\n1. Pellets may stick together if the tray is moved.\\n2. Air currents may affect the uniformity of heating.\\n3. Difficult to anneal appropriate amounts of gold.\\n4.

The fuel for the flame may be alcohol or gas. Alcohol is preferred as there is less danger of contamination. The alcohol should be pure methanol or ethanol without colorants or other additives.',\n",

Less danger of oversintering.\\nUnder-heating does not remove impurities well and results in incomplete cohesion. Carbon deposited by the flame can cause pitting and flaking of the surface. Overheating leads to oversintering and possibly contamination from the tray, instruments or flame. This results in incomplete cohesion, embrittlement of the portion being heated and poor compaction characteristics. Overheating can result from too long a time even at a proper temperature or from too high a temperature.\\n# Compaction\\n- Hand mallet\\n- Pneumatic vibratory condensers\\n- Electrically driven condensers\\n---\\n9A to F Some of the steps in the placement of a direct filling gold restoration.\\n|(A) The cavity is designed for retention and resistance.|(B) Gold is wedged into the corners of the box and condensed.|\\n|---|---|\\n|(C) No. 4 gold foil is used on the surface of the restoration to reduce porosity.|(D) Shaping the proximal side with an abrasive strip.|\\n|(E) Finishing and polishing is done with a variety of burs, stones, abrasive points and disks (sof-lex).|(F) The completed restoration.

Subsequently additional foil is wedged in the same manner, till the cavity is filled (Figs. 10.9A to F). Each increment of gold must be carefully ‘stepped’ by placing the condenser point in successive adjacent positions. This permits each piece to be compacted over its entire surface so that voids are not bridged.\\n---\\n(A and C) Electromallet for mechanical compaction of gold.\\n(B) Gold condensation tips.',\n",

These serrations act as swaggers, exerting lateral forces on their inclines in addition to providing direct compressive forces. They also cut through the outer layers to allow air trapped below the surface to escape.\\nThis is an important factor in determining the effectiveness of compaction. Small condenser points compact without using forces that might damage oral structures. The diameter of circular points should be 0.5 mm and 1 mm.\\nElectromagnetic or spring-loaded (not used nowadays), pneumatic (compressed air powered), and electric mallet (Figs. 10.10A to C) have provided a mechanical means of applying force. The mechanical devices consist of points activated by comparatively light blows that are repeated with frequencies that range from 360–3600/minute.\\nFaster and more comfortable for the patient.\\nAs with amalgam the cavity is slightly overfilled. The surface is probed with an explorer to test for proper compaction and to make sure all voids are eliminated. If the probe penetrates easily, condensation is continued with more force. The excess is removed with a gold file or burs. The surface is burnished with a ball burnisher to strain harden the surface. Final polish (optional) is achieved with soflex disks (Figs. 10.9A to F) or other commercially available gold polishing kits.\\n---\\n|Type|Transverse|Hardness|Density|\\n|---|---|---|---|\\n|Mat gold|161-169 MPa|52-60 KHN|14.3-14.7 g/cm3|\\n|Powdered gold|155-190 MPa|55-64 KHN|14.4-14.9 g/cm3|\\n|Gold foil|265-296 MPa|69 KHN|15.8-15.9 g/cm3|\\n|Mat/gold foil|196-227 MPa|70-75 KHN|15.0-15.1 g/cm3|\\nFailure occurs from tensile stress, due to incomplete cohesion.

Thus transverse strength is a measure of cohesion.\\n# HARDNESS\\nThe hardness indicates the overall quality of compacted gold. A reduction in hardness probably indicates the presence of porosity.\\n# DENSITY\\nTrue density of pure gold is 19.3 g/cm3. However in DFGs this is not achieved, because it is not possible to eliminate voids completely during compaction. Thus density of DFGs is usually less than ideal. The transverse strength, hardness and (apparent) density are somewhat greater when gold foil is used alone or in combination with mat gold, as compared with other forms. The difference in physical properties among the various forms of gold including the gold-calcium alloy and the method of compaction are not clinically significant. The physical properties are probably more greatly influenced by the competence of the operator in manipulating and placing the gold.\\n# EFFECT OF VOIDS\\nThe amount of voids is estimated by the apparent density of compacted gold. Voids on the restoration surface (pits) increase the susceptibility to corrosion and deposition of plaque. Voids at the restoration-tooth interface may cause gross leakage and secondary caries development (in properly compacted gold, microleakage is minimum).\\n# TARNISH AND CORROSION\\nResistance to tarnish and corrosion is good, if compacted well.\\n# BIOCOMPATIBILITY\\nThe pulpal response is minimal if compacted well.

These were used extensively in the early 20th century. Though, they had a fluoride release mechanism they eroded quickly and had a problem of marginal discoloration.\\nSilicates were subsequently replaced by the tooth colored acrylic resins. These were basically polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) resins similar to those used in dentures. They were widely welcomed at the time because of their superior aesthetics, ease of manipulation, low cost and insolubility in oral fluids.',\n",
       " 'The material was supplied as a powder and liquid (in brown bottles). With time however, many restorations began to fail, due to microleakage, staining and caries. This happened primarily because these materials shrink on setting causing them to pull away from the cavity walls. Their high thermal expansion and contraction caused further stresses at the margins. In addition, they had poor wear resistance. The monomer within was also implicated in pulpal irritation especially in deep restorations. Manufacturers tried to offset these problems by adding quartz filler particles. This greatly reduced the shrinkage by reducing the proportion of resin in the mix. It also reduced the thermal expansion. However, the quartz did not bond to the resin which resulted in staining and poor wear resistance.\\n---\\n# COMPOSITE RESINS\\nEssentially, it is a resin which has been strengthened by adding silica particles called fillers. The pioneering research of Bowen together with the development of the acid etching technique and bonding agents, revolutionized restorative dentistry. It largely replaced the earlier silicate and restorative acrylics.\\nThe composite is a system composed of a mixture of two or more macromolecules, which are essentially insoluble in each other and differ in form. The composite material’s properties are superior to those of its individual components, e.g. fiberglass has a resin matrix which is reinforced by glass fibers. The resulting composite is harder and stiffer than the resin matrix material, but less brittle than glass. Examples of natural composite materials are tooth enamel and dentin. Matrix is made of collagen, with hydroxyapatite crystals acting as fillers. Though the early composites were developed for restorative purposes their uses subsequently expanded to include provisional restorations, luting, etc.\\n# USES\\n- Restoration of anterior (Figs. 11.1A and B) and posterior teeth (directly or indirectly).',\n",

The early composite resins were generally macrofilled resins and were referred to as conventional composites. These were chemically activated. This was followed by UV light-activated and later visible light-activated systems. The early composites had poor wear resistance and stained easily. This was attributed to the large-sized (macrofillers) filler particles used. The introduction of the microfilled composites improved wear resistance and better aesthetics. However, they had poor mechanical properties. The hybrid composites attempted to combine the aesthetics and wear resistance of the microfilled with the mechanical properties of the macrofilled composites. The latest entry into the field - the nanocomposites (4) holds the promise of high polishability with further improvement in mechanical properties.\\n- Composite resin (either chemical or light-cured)\\n- Etching liquid (37% phosphoric acid)\\n- Bonding agent',\n",

Bis-GMA and TEGDMA have a refractive index of 1.55 and 1.46 respectively which average to around 1.5 when combined together.\\n# FILLER PARTICLES\\nFunctions of fillers Addition of filler particles into the resin significantly improves its properties.\\n1.

The smaller the size and higher the concentration of fillers the better the wear resistance.\\nSurface smoothness and esthetics—Fillers affect the surface smoothness and subsequent esthetics of the composite. The smaller the particle size, the greater the polishability. Larger particle sizes in the early composites contributed to surface roughness and staining.\\nReduces water sorption—Resins absorb water and makes it more prone to wear and staining. Filler reduce water sorption by reducing the overall resin content.\\nReduces thermal expansion and contraction—Fillers have a lower CTE in comparison to the resin.\\nImproves clinical handling (increased viscosity makes them easier to handle clinically).\\nImparts radiopacity—Radiopaque fillers help improve diagnostics (e.g. caries detection through roentgenograms, etc.).\\n- Amount of filler added (filler loading)\\n- Size of particles and its distribution\\n- Shape of fillers\\n- Index of refraction\\n- Radiopacity\\n- Hardness',\n",

The smaller the fillers the greater the surface smoothness. Microfilled composites have the best surface smoothness and lowest wear. This is because the particles are removed at the same rate as the resin matrix if they are smaller. Larger particles result in a rougher surface. The introduction of the nanoparticles hold great promise of improved smoothness, good wear resistance as well as improved mechanical properties.\\nFiller loading Filler loading refers to the amount of fillers that can be practically incorporated into the resin. The amount of filler that can be added depends on the type of filler and the purpose for which it is intended. Most hybrid composites have a filler loading ranging from 60 to 70% volume. The introduction of the newer nanofillers allow a greater filler loading of up to 79.5% vol. Microfillers thicken the resin quickly. Thus microfilled resins usually do not have the same filler loading as resins with larger particle sizes such as the hybrids.\\nParticle size distribution Most modern hybrid composites have particles range in size from 0.01 to 10 μm. Microfillers are usually in the range of 0.01 – 0.07 (average 0.04 μm). In order to increase the filler amount in the resin, it is necessary to add the fillers in a range of particle sizes. If a single particle size is used, a space will exist between the particles. Smaller particles can then fill-up these spaces, thus increasing the filler content (Figs. 11.8A to E).\\nShape of fillers Based on shape 3 types of fillers are used—irregular, spherical and fibrous. The shape affects the filler loading and the handling characteristics of the composite.',\n",

Weight percent is usually higher in value than percent volume. The volume percentage may be a more reliable indicator of filler content than the weight percentage. This is because of differences in density between different fillers. For example, composites can have a similar volume percentage of fillers yet different weight percentages. This is because the composite containing a larger fraction of heavy metal glass fillers will have a higher weight percentage.\\n- Ground quartz\\n- Glasses or ceramic containing heavy metals\\n- Boron silicates\\n- Lithium aluminum silicates\\n- Ytterbium trifluoride\\n- Colloidal silica\\nThey are obtained by grinding or milling quartz.

In microfilled composites it is the main filler used (20 to 59% volume). Since they cannot be added in large amounts the overall filler loading of microfilled composites is lower than conventional or hybrid varieties.\\nManufacturers are constantly on the look out for methods to increase the filler content of the microfilled composites.\\n1. One method is to sinter (fuse) the colloidal silica particles, thereby reducing surface area. These are known as agglomerated silica.\\n2. Addition of prepolymerized fillers This is the more common method. Also known as 'organic fillers'. They are prepared by adding 60 to 70 wt.% of silane coated colloidal silica to the monomer, which is held at a slightly higher temperature to reduce its viscosity.

Nanoparticles in composites can be used in 2 forms.\\n- Nanoparticle—a single nanoparticle (size ranges from 5-25 nm)\\n- Nanoclusters—a group of nanoparticles (forms larger sized particles).\\nFiller particles can be generated: (1) by crushing, grinding, and sieving large blocks of ceramic, (2) by condensation of SiO2 from the vapor phase as small droplets of microfiller, or (3) by precipitation of filler particles from solution (sol-gel). The smallest fillers can only be manufactured in a practical way from the vapor phase or by sol-gel processes.\\nCoupling agents bond the filler particles to the resin matrix. The earliest composites did not use coupling agents. This resulted in microscopic defects between the filler and surrounding resin. Microleakage of fluids into these defects led to surface staining and failure. Typically the manufacturer treats the surface of the filler with a coupling agent to bond the filler to the resin matrix.\\n---\\nThey improve the properties of the resin through transfer of stresses from the more plastic resin matrix to the stiffer filler particles.\\nThey prevent water from penetrating the filler-resin interface.\\nThey bond the fillers to the resin matrix thereby reducing the wear.',\n",

The other end has a methacrylate group which forms a covalent bond with the resin when it is polymerized. This completes the coupling process. Zirconates and titanates can also be used as coupling agents.\\n# POLYMERIZATION (SETTING) MECHANISMS\\nThey polymerize by the addition mechanism that is initiated by free radicals as described in resins.

This is in the blue region of the visible light spectrum. In some cases inhibitors are added to enhance its stability to room light or dental operatory light.\\nA combination of chemical and light curing is used to overcome some of the drawbacks of light curing. Dual cure resins are supplied as two pastes. When mixed together a slow setting reaction is initiated. These resins are used for cementing crowns or bulk restorations where there is limited or no light penetration. After the initial light cure, the remainder of the resin cures over a period of time by the chemical process.\\nA number of curing lights are manufactured. Most use visible light in the blue spectrum (between 400 and 500 nm). In some units the light source is remote and is transmitted to the site of restoration through a light guide which is a long, flexible fiber-optic cord. There are also hand held light curing devices which transmit the light through short light guides (10).\\n1. Spectral range Light emitted by curing lamps should fall in the photoabsorption spectral range of camphorquinone. This is in the violet-blue region of the spectrum and is between 400-500 nm.

It is similar in power to QTH lamps (700 mW/cm2). Research has shown that the curing depth and degree of conversion is significantly better with LEDs than with QTH. It emits light only in the blue part of the spectrum. Thus, it does not require filters. Its advantages also include low power consumption (can even be operated by batteries), no heat generation (eliminating cooling fan), and low noise (due to the absence of cooling fan).\\nThese lamps generate an intense white light by ionizing xenon gas to produce a plasma. Filters are required to remove heat and the unwanted wavelengths. Their high power allows faster cures as well as greater depth of cures.\\nThese produce light of the greatest intensity. They emit light of a single wavelength around 490 nm and therefore do not require filters. They do not produce little heat because of the limited infrared. However, these lamps are more expensive. They have a narrow light tip (spot size) requiring clinicians to increase number of overlaps in case of a larger restoration.\\nThe high intensity lights like the PAC and the laser provide a faster cure (as short as 5 seconds for a 2 mm section).

The acid is rinsed off and the area is dried thoroughly. Bonding agent An enamel or dentin bond agent is applied and polymerized. (Discussed in detail subsequently). The cavity is now ready for the composite.\\nTECHNIQUES OF INSERTION Resins are manipulated with plastic or plastic coated instruments. Metal instruments should be avoided as it may abrade and discolor the composite. Composites are tacky and stick to metal instruments. Some operators use alcohol or bonding liquid as a release agent to reduce tackiness. However, this should be avoided as it can interfere with the properties of the resin. This is especially true of the bonding agent as it can dissolve the resin matrix and cause dilution. It is inserted into the cavity using a plastic instrument or a special syringe. Some manufacturers supply it in the form of a capsule which can be injected directly into the cavity with a special extruding gun.\\nCHEMICALLY ACTIVATED COMPOSITES The correct proportions of base and catalyst pastes are dispensed onto a mixing pad and combined by rapid spatulation for 30 seconds. It is inserted while still plastic for better adaptation to cavity walls. Air inclusions can be avoided by swiping the material into one side of the cavity and filling the cavity from bottom outward. The cavity is slightly overfilled. A matrix strip is used to apply pressure and to avoid inhibition by air.',\n",
       " 'LIGHT ACTIVATED COMPOSITES The light activated composites are single component pastes and require no mixing. The working time is under the control of the operator. Effect of ambient light Light cured composites are vulnerable to prolonged exposure to ambient room light or the operatory light if they are left exposed and unprotected on the mixing pad. The composite begins slow polymerization as soon as it is exposed to ambient light and within 60 to 90 seconds it may lose its ability to flow. Therefore, some precautions to be observed when using light activated materials.\\n- The paste is dispensed just before use\\n- Avoid dispensing excessive quantities\\n- The depth of cure is limited, so in deep cavities the restorations must be built up in increments, each increment being cured before inserting the next\\n- Between cures any excess material is protected by covering with a light proof dark or orange tinted cover\\n---\\na high intensity light unit should be used. The light tip should be held as close as possible to the restoration. The exposure time should be no less than 40 to 60 seconds. The resin should be no greater than 2.0 to 2.5 mm thick. Darker shades require longer exposure times, as do resins that are cured through enamel. Microfilled resins also require a longer exposure.\\nRetinal damage The high intensity light can cause retinal damage if one looks at it directly. Avoiding looking at the light directly and use of protective eye glasses is recommended. Even greater care should be exercised when using laser as even a short exposure can cause damage.\\n1. Incremental curing The restoration is built-up in increments each increment being cured before inserting the next.\\n2. Soft-start technique The curing is started with low intensity and finished with high intensity. This extends the time for stress relaxation. Some commercially available lamps have this feature built in. Ramped curing is a variation of this technique.',\n",
       " '3. Delayed curing In delayed curing the restoration is partially cured at low intensity. The operator then completes the shaping and contouring and follows it with a second exposure for the final cure.\\nFINISHING AND POLISHING Finishing is best done after 24 hours during which time the polymerization is complete. However, if a subsequent appointment is not desired finishing procedures can be started 15 minutes after curing. The initial contouring can be done with a knife or diamond stone. The final finishing is done with rubber impregnated abrasives or rubber cup with polishing pastes or aluminium oxide disks. The best finish is obtained when the composite is allowed to set against a matrix or mylar strip. Special glazes and coatings are available. These are basically lightly filled resins. They are applied with a brush on the surface of the restoration and cured.\\nBONDING One of the initial problems when resin restoratives were introduced was microleakage which resulted from the shrinkage of the resin while curing. The problem was overcome to a great extent by the introduction of the ‘acid etch technique’ by Buonocore in 1955. The acid etch technique used a combination of acid to etch the tooth and a bonding agent to improve the retention of the composite resin to the tooth (Box 11.2).\\n|Etchant|The etchant is an acid which selectively dissolves the tooth structure to provide retention for the restoration. They are also known as conditioners. The most popular etchant is 37% phosphoric acid.|\\n|---|---|\\n|Primer|Primers are hydrophilic monomers usually carried in a solvent. Because of their hydrophilic nature they are able to penetrate the moist tooth structure especially the dentin and its collagen mesh thus improving the bond. Thus they serve as a bridge connecting the tooth structure to the adhesive. The solvent used are acetone, ethanol or water. Some are used without solvents.|',\n",
       " '|Adhesive|Adhesives are generally hydrophobic monomers. Being hydrophobic they do not wet the tooth leading to air entrapment, air inhibition and thereby poor bonding. Thus they have to be used in combination with primers to form an effective bond to tooth structure. The adhesive bonds the resin to the primer which in turn penetrates and binds to the tooth structure thus completing the bonding sequence.|\\n---\\n- Dentin could not be etched as well as enamel\\n- Acid etching of dentin would cause injury to the pulp\\nOne reason for the low bond strength to dentin was because of the hydrophobic nature of the early adhesive resins. In 1979 Fusyama demonstrated that dentin could be etched without causing any significant harm to the pulp. This together with the development of hydrophilic bonding agents significantly improved the bond strength to dentin. The acid etch technique together with the application of current bonding agents is one of the most effective ways of improving the bond and marginal seal between resin and tooth structure.\\n# ETCHANT/CONDITIONER\\n- Mineral (e.g. phosphoric, nitric acid, etc)\\n- Organic (e.g. maleic, citric, ethylene-diamine-tetracetic (EDTA), etc.)\\n- Polymeric (e.g. polyacrylic acid).\\nThe most frequently used etchant is 37% phosphoric acid. The acid in concentrations greater than 50% results in the formation of monocalcium phosphate monohydrate that reduces further dissolution. It may be supplied as clear or colored gel or liquid. Brushes are used to apply or the acid is supplied in a syringe for direct application onto the enamel. Another acid used is 10% maleic acid.\\n# MODE OF ACTION ON ENAMEL\\n1. It creates microporosities by discrete etching of the enamel, i.e., by selective dissolution of enamel rod centers, or peripheries, or both.\\n2. Etching increases the surface area.',\n",
       " '1. It creates microporosities by discrete etching of the enamel, i.e., by selective dissolution of enamel rod centers, or peripheries, or both.\\n2. Etching increases the surface area.\\n3. Etched enamel has a high surface energy, allowing the resin to wet the tooth surface better and penetrate into the microporosities. When polymerized, it forms resin ‘tags’ which forms a mechanical bond to the enamel.\\n---\\n1. Removes smear layer and partially opens the dentinal tubules (19).\\n2. Provides modest etching of the intertubular dentin.\\nThe tooth is cleaned and polished with pumice before etching. The phosphoric acid is then applied onto the enamel and then on to the dentin (also known as total-etch technique). Originally the length of application was set at 60 seconds but now it has been shown that 15 seconds is sufficient. The etching time also depends on the history of the tooth, e.g. a tooth with high fluoride content and primary teeth requires longer etching time (to produce a similar etch pattern and bond strength 10% 19 SEM of etched dentin maleic acid needed at least 60 seconds of etching time). The acid along with dissolved minerals should be rinsed off with a stream of water for 15 seconds and the enamel dried using compressed air. After drying the enamel should have a white, frosted appearance (20). This surface must be kept clean and dry until the resin is placed. Even momentary contact of saliva, or blood can prevent effective resin tag formation and severely reduce the bond strength.',\n",
       " 'Desiccation (excessive drying) of the dentin should be avoided. Desiccation can result in the collapse of the collagen mesh (21A) or network which forms a dense film that is difficult to penetrate by the bond agent. The collagen mesh is crucial in the formation of the hybrid layer (21B). The monomers impregnate and became entangled with the collagen fibrils of surface demineralized dentin, creating a hybrid layer after their polymerization. The hybrid layer together with the resin tags forms the prime mechanism for the adhesion of the composite restoration in dentin. 20 Frosted appearance after After drying the tooth the dentin may be lightly a 15 second etch with 37% phosphoric acid. remoistened with cotton and then blotted dry.\\n21A AND B (A) SEM of etched non-desiccated dentin showing collagen mesh (x 5000).

The more viscous composite did not bond well to the etched enamel. The enamel bond agent helped improve the bond by flowing into all the microporosities of the etched enamel and creating a mechanical retention.\\nThey are unfilled resins similar to that of the resin matrix of composite resin, diluted by other monomers to lower the viscosity. These materials have been replaced by agents that bond to both enamel and dentin.\\nBond strengths to etched enamel range from 16 MPa (230 Psi) to 22 MPa (3200 Psi). Drying the enamel with warm air or using an ethanol rinse can increase the bond strength.\\n- It is heterogeneous.\\n- The high water content interferes with bonding. Its tubular nature provides a variable area.\\n- Presence of a smear layer on the cut dentin surface (The smear layer is the layer of debris which adheres tightly to the dentin and fills the tubules after cavity cutting).',\n",
       " '- Presence of a smear layer on the cut dentin surface (The smear layer is the layer of debris which adheres tightly to the dentin and fills the tubules after cavity cutting).\\nIdeally, the bond agent should be hydrophilic to displace the water and thereby wet the surface, permitting it to penetrate the porosities in dentin as well as react with the organic/inorganic components. Restorative resins are hydrophobic, therefore, bonding agents should contain both hydrophilic and hydrophobic parts. The hydrophilic part bonds with either calcium in the hydroxyapatite crystals or with collagen. The hydrophobic part bonds with the restorative resin.\\nDentin bond systems are supplied in one or more bottles containing conditioners (etchant)/primers/ and adhesive depending on the generation (see box below and also evolution of dentin bond agents - the various generations).\\nFor ease of description the evolution of bonding agents for composite resins are described under various generations (see also Table 11.3).\\n---\\n|Generation|Enamel etchant|Dentin conditioner/primer|Adhesive|\\n|---|---|---|---|\\n|1st generation|37% phosphoric acid|(not recommended)|GPDM|\\n|2nd generation|37% phosphoric acid|(not recommended)|Phenyl-P BisGMA/TEGDMA MPPA|\\n|3rd generation|37% phosphoric acid|Citric acid (10%)/CaCl (20%) Oxalic acid/aluminium nitrate EDTA|NPG-GMA/BPDM BisGMA/TEGDMA HEMA/BPDM 4 META/MMA HEMA/GPDM|\\n|4th generation|37% phosphoric HEMA/BPDM|(total etch technique)|NPG-GMA/BPDM BisGMA/TEGDMA HEMA/BPDM 4 META/MMA HEMA/GPDM|\\n|5th generation|37% phosphoric|(total etch technique)|PENTA, Methacrylated phosphonates|\\n|6th generation| |Methacrylated phosphates in water (acidic primer-adhesive)| |\\n|7th generation| |Methacrylated phosphates in water (acidic primer-adhesive)| |\\n|BisGMA|Bisphenol-A-glycidyl methacrylate|MMA|Methyl methacrylate|\\n|---|---|---|---|\\n|BPDM|Biphenyl dimethacrylate|MPPA|2-methacryloxyphenyl phosphoric acid|',\n",

Leakage was a concern at the dentin-resin interphase.\\nSecond generation (1970s) Developed as adhesive agents for composite resins which had by then replaced acrylic restorations. One system used NPG-GMA. It was proposed that the NPG portion bonded to the calcium of the tooth by chelation. Other products included phenyl-P, 2-methacryloxy phenyl phosphoric acid. Bond strengths achieved were three times more than the earlier generations.\\nDisadvantage Bond strengths were still low. The adhesion was short term and the bond eventually hydrolysed, e.g. Prisma, Universal Bond, Clearfil, Scotch Bond.\\nThird generation (1980s) The third generation bond agents made a serious attempt to deal with the smear layer which is formed when dentin is cut. It was believed that the smear layer prevented proper bonding to the underlying dentin. Yet its complete removal by aggressive etching was contraindicated because it was believed that it protected the pulp by preventing direct contact with the monomer. The third generation bond agents had bond strengths comparable to that of resin to etched enamel. Thus bond strengths improved to 12 to 15 MPa. However, their use is more complex and requires two to three application steps.\\n- Etching of enamel using 37% phosphoric acid\\n- Conditioning of dentin using mild acids\\n- Application of separate primer\\n- Application of polymerizable monomer\\n- Placement of the resin.\\n---',\n",

Research showed that acid etching of dentin did not significantly harm the pulp as long as bacterial contamination and microleakage was avoided. Thus, the total-etch technique was introduced.\\nIn 1982, Nakabayashi and Fusayama reported the formation of a hybrid layer. The hybrid layer is defined as “the structure formed in dental hard tissues (enamel, dentin, cementum) by demineralization of the surface and subsurface, followed by infiltration of monomers into the collagen mesh (21) and subsequent polymerization. However, dealing with the collagen mesh was not easy. It is delicate and can be destroyed by desiccation. Kanca (1991) introduced the idea of wet bonding again breaking with the traditional belief that thorough drying was necessary to improve bonding.\\nExamples are All Bond 2, Scotch bond multipurpose (22), Optibond, etc.\\nThe All Bond consists of 2 primers (NPG-GMA and Biphenyl dimethacrylate (BPDM) and an unfilled resin adhesive (40% BIS-GMA, 30% UDMA, 30% HEMA). This system bonds composite not only to dentin but to most dental related surfaces like enamel, casting alloys, amalgam, porcelain and composite. Bond strengths were high but as with the earlier system, multiple application steps were required.\\n# Fifth generation (mid 1990s)',\n",

The bonding is more probably micromechanical, due to the penetration of the polymerizable monomer into the finely textured primed dentin. A fine collagen mesh exists on the surface of the dentin which current bond agents are able to infiltrate because of their hydrophilic components. One more precaution is that the dentin should not be dried excessively as desiccation can cause the collapse of the fine collagen meshwork (See 19) thereby reducing the bond strength.\\nCurrent dentin bond agents generate bond strengths comparable to that of resin to etched enamel. Bond strength is difficult to measure because of the wide variations in the dentin itself, test methods, and other factors. Bond strength reduces with increased depth of dentin. Various studies have shown values ranging from 15 to 35 MPa. An increasing number of studies are using the microtensile test methodology. The size of the specimen is smaller (1 mm2 in cross section). Thus, a number of specimens can be prepared from the same tooth thereby increasing the uniformity of the study.\\nThese are important tests related to the performance of the bonding system. A test for microleakage is indicative of the success or failure of a bond. These tests are done using tracers and staining to determine the depth of penetration.\\nComposite resins may be repaired by adding new material over the old. This is useful in correcting defects or altering contours of an existing restoration. The procedure differs depending on whether the restoration is fresh or old.\\n---\\nthan 50% of unreacted methacrylate groups are available to copolymerize with the newly added material.',\n",

Place fresh composite after applying bonding agent.\\n# SANDWICH TECHNIQUE\\nComposite does not bond adequately to dentin, therefore during polymerization, a gap may result if the cavity margin is situated in dentin. The bond to dentin can be improved by placing a glass ionomer liner between the composite restoration and dentin. The glass ionomer bonds to the dentin through chemical adhesion whereas the resin bonds mechanically to porosities and crazing present on the surface of the glass ionomer liner. The glass ionomer can also be etched with the help of phosphoric acid to improve retention. In addition it also provides an anticariogenic effect due to its fluoride release. When used in this context it is often referred to as ‘sandwich technique’.\\n# Indications\\n1. Lesions where one or more margins are in dentin, e.g. cervical lesions.\\n2. Class II composite restorations.\\n# Procedure\\nDentin is conditioned and a thin layer of GIC cement is placed. The cement must be exposed at the margins in order to achieve fluoride release. Phosphoric acid is used to etch the enamel portion. Some operators also etch the GIC surface with the same phosphoric acid for 15 to 20 seconds to increase surface roughness (light cured GIC is not etched). The surface is then washed for 25 to 30 seconds. After adequate drying, a bond agent is applied to the cement surface and to the etched enamel. The composite resin is then inserted in the usual manner.\\n# SPECIALIZED COMPOSITE RESINS\\n# FLOWABLE COMPOSITES',\n",

They are not condensable like classic amalgam, rather they can be compressed and forced to flow using flat faced instruments, hence the term packable. They are considered as posterior composites. The distinguishing characteristics of all packable compositions are less stickiness or stiffer viscosity than conventional composites, which allow them to be placed in a manner that somewhat resembles amalgam placement. They have a higher wear resistance. Claims also include a greater depth of cure and low polymerization shrinkage. In general, mechanical properties of packable composites are not substantially better than those of most conventional universal composites.\\nCommercial examples: Solitaire (Heraeus), ALERT (Jeneric), and SureFil (Dentsply).\\nThey are indicated for use in Classes I and II cavities.

They may be fabricated using the direct method or indirect method.\\nHybrid or microfilled resins are used. A separating medium (agar solution or glycerine) is applied to the prepared tooth.

They are highly colored opaque materials. They are usually chemically cured or dual cured with a longer working time and shorter setting time. Some concerns exist regarding the strength of composite cores when compared to cast post and cores. Failures are often seen when these materials form the bulk of the support for crowns and FDPs.

As with all materials expressed from cartridges, the material that comes initially should be discarded as it may not be in the correct proportions.\\nComposite resin blanks are available for the fabrication of long term (up to 1 year) provisional restorations including crowns and fixed partial dentures. They are fabricated by a CAD/CAM process (see chapter on ceramics for further details of the process). One such product is the Everest C-Temp (Kavo) (32). The whole restoration may be fabricated as one piece or it may be fabricated as a framework which is subsequently veneered with conventional prosthodontic resins. These resins are characterized by high flexural strength.\\n32 Composite resin CAD/CAM blanks.',\n",

Both deciduous molars and young permanent molars with deep pits and fissures are common candidates. Commonly surfaces that are free of caries should be selected. However, a recent study where the sealant was placed intentionally in pits and fissures having caries showed that the lesion did not progress.\\n# Types\\n|Based on filler content|Based on curing mechanism|Color|\\n|---|---|---|\\n|2 types are available—Filled and Unfilled|light cured or chemical cured|The sealants are available as transparent, tooth colored, opaque, tinted or white materials. The color contrast helps to determine the efficacy of the application. Recent products include photosensitive color reversible sealants. These sealants are normally colorless but change to a pink or green when exposed to a curing light. The color change which lasts about 5–10 minutes is useful for diagnosis during periodic recalls.|\\n# Composition\\nThe most commonly and successfully used sealant is bis-GMA (Figs. 11.33B and C). It may be cured chemically (amine-peroxide system) or by light. The bis-GMA resin is mixed with a diluent to obtain a low viscosity sealant that flows readily. In filled sealants small amounts of filler (up to 40%) are added to improve its stiffness and wear resistance. Other resins systems include polyurethanes and cyanoacrylates.\\n# Properties',\n",
       " '# Properties\\nImportant properties of sealants are flow, wear resistance, fluoride release and long term retention. Sealants must have low viscosity so that they will flow readily into the depths of the pits and fissures (33A) and wet the tooth. Wettability is also important for proper adaptation and penetration. Acid etching improves the wettability. Proper retention of the sealant is important for caries prevention. Acid etching with bonding agents is necessary for the retention of the sealant. The sealant must have sufficient mechanical properties like strength, stiffness and wear resistance for effective function and durability. Sealants with fillers usually have better mechanical properties than unfilled resins.\\n33A TO C Pit and fissure sealants. (A) Diagrammatic representation of a sealant in a fissure.

Air inhibition during polymerization is also a problem in sealants. The tacky air inhibited layer is removed using a pumice paste on a cotton pellet or rotary cup or brush. The operator must ensure that sufficient thickness of sealant is applied to compensate for this loss. The unpolymerized surface layer was once a health concern because of the presence of BPA (bisphenol A) which is chemical similar to estrogen. However, this has since been discredited and is no longer a major concern.\\nEarly clinical studies showed a retention rate of 42% and a caries reduction rate of 35% over 5 years. Improvements in materials and technique over the years have dramatically improved the success rates. Current studies indicate a success rate of over 90% in caries reduction.',\n",
       " 'Evidence has shown that sealant therapy cannot be taken for granted. The sealant should be re-examined every six months. If the sealant is missing it should be reapplied. Improper case selection and application of sealant may actually enhance caries.\\nOver the years various types of materials have been used for denture teeth. Traditionally conventional acrylic (Biotone), cross-linked acrylics (SR-Postaris, Genios-P, etc.) and porcelain denture teeth are used. Since their introduction composite resins too have been tried as denture teeth. Some examples are nano-filled (Veracia) and micro-filled composites (SR-Orthosit, Endura, Duradent, Surpass). In one study, the composites and cross-linked acrylic resins did not show significant difference in wear resistance properties.

Three-dimensional obturation to prevent reinfection (1).\\nIrrigation is an essential part of root canal debridement because it allows for cleaning beyond what might be achieved by root canal instrumentation alone. Disinfection of the root canal system is one of the primary aims of root canal treatment. This can be achieved through the use of various antimicrobial agents in the form of irrigants (only used for relatively short periods of time) and medicaments (days or several weeks). The main objective of root canal obturation is to achieve a three-dimensional well-filled root canal with a fluid-tight seal (1). It serves to prevent percolation and microleakage of periapical exudate into the root canal space and create a favorable environment for the healing process.\\n1: A root canal treated tooth.\\n---\\n# The materials used in Endodontics may be grouped as follows:\\n# ROOT CANAL IRRIGANTS',\n",

Root canal irrigants must not only be effective for dissolution of the organic portions of the dental pulp, but also effectively eliminate bacterial contamination and remove the smear layer (the organic and inorganic layer) that is created on the walls of the root canal during instrumentation.\\n# Desirable properties:\\n1. Irrigants should have a broad antimicrobial spectrum and high efficacy against anaerobic and facultative microorganisms organized in biofilms.\\n2. Dissolve necrotic pulp tissue remnants.\\n3. Inactivate endotoxin.\\n4. Should be nontoxic, noncarcinogenic and nonantigenic.\\n5. Should be able to disinfect and penetrate dentin and its tubules.\\n6.

In dentistry, sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl) is a popular irrigating solution for Endodontic use.\\nSolutions in various concentrations between 0.5% and 6% in bottles (2).\\nNaOCl ionizes in water into Na+ and the hypochlorite ion, OCl. The OCl ion in turn combines with water to form Hypochlorous acid (HOCl).\\nHypochlorous acid is responsible for the antibacterial activity; the OCl ion is less effective than the undissolved HOCl. Hypochlorous acid disrupts several vital functions of the microbial cell resulting in cell death. At acidic and neutral pH, chlorine exists predominantly as HOCl, whereas at high pH of 9 and above, OCl predominates.\\nIt is a potent antimicrobial agent, killing most bacteria instantly on direct contact. It also effectively dissolves pulpal remnants and collagen, the main organic components of dentin. Hypochlorite is the only root canal irrigant of those in general use that dissolves necrotic and vital organic tissue. Although hypochlorite alone does not remove the smear layer, it affects the organic part of the smear layer, making its complete removal possible by subsequent irrigation with EDTA or citric acid (CA). It is used as an unbuffered solution at pH 11 in the various concentrations mentioned earlier, or buffered with bicarbonate buffer (pH 9.0), usually as a 0.5% (Dakin solution) or 1% solution.\\nSodium hypochlorite is the most important irrigating solution and the only one capable of dissolving organic tissue, including biofilm and the organic part of the smear layer. It should be used throughout the instrumentation phase.\\n---',\n",

The use of irrigation tips with side venting reduces the possibility of forcing solutions into the periapical tissues. Treatment of NaOCl accidents is palliative and consists of observation of the patient as well as prescribing antibiotics and analgesics.\\nSodium hypochlorite is generally not utilized in its most active form in a clinical setting. For proper antimicrobial activity, it must be prepared freshly just before its use. It should be stored at room temperature and not exposed to oxygen for extended periods of time. Exposure of the solution to oxygen and light can inactivate it significantly.\\nChlorhexidine has a broad-spectrum antimicrobial action and relatively little toxicity. Chlorhexidine (CHX) however, lacks the tissue-dissolving ability. It penetrates the cell wall and attacks the bacterial cytoplasmic or inner membrane or the yeast plasma membrane. It may be used in concentrations between 0.2% and 2%. Its activity is pH dependent and is greatly reduced in the presence of organic matter.\\nIt is a clear, colorless liquid used in a variety of concentrations. 1%–30% H2O2 is active against viruses, bacteria, and yeasts.\\n|Endo-CHX|CHX Endo-2%|\\n|---|---|\\n|CHLORHEXIDINE GLUCONATE|Hydrogen Peroxide|\\n|750-16 ml|20 volume 696 ml|\\n4 Chlorhexidine irrigant.\\n5 Hydrogen peroxide irrigant.\\n---\\nIt produces hydroxyl free radicals (OH), which attack several cell components such as proteins and DNA.

       " '# GUTTA-PERCHA\\nGutta-percha is a polymeric resin-like material obtained from the coagulation of latex produced by Palaquium gutta tree (commonly known as the Isonandra gutta tree). Gutta-percha is a name derived from the Malay words ‘getah’ meaning gum and pertja’ (name of the tree in Malay). Long before Gutta-percha was introduced into the western world, it was used in crude form by the natives of Malaysian archipelago for making knife handles, walking sticks and other purposes (Box 13.1).\\n# Manufacture of gutta-percha (Obach’s technique)\\n---\\n# Box 13.1 History of Gutta-percha\\nGutta-percha trees are native to South East Asia and Australia. Their sap is similar to rubber. It’s actually a natural polymer-like rubber. Though very similar to it, unlike rubber, Gutta-percha is biologically inert - it doesn’t react with biological materials - and that was the key to its usefulness. It was discovered by Western explorers in the middle of the 17th century, though local Malay people already knew about it and used it. The first Westerner to discover this material was John Tradescant, who brought this material after his travels from far-east in 1656, he named this material as “Mazer wood”. But the honour of introduction of this material goes to Dr. William Montogmerie, who was a medical officer in Indian service. He was the first to appreciate the potential of this material in medicine and for which he was awarded the gold medal by the Royal Society of Arts, London in 1841. As soon as it was introduced, it found use as an insulating medium in the laying of underground seawater cables. The first Gutta-percha patent was taken by Alexander, Cabriol and Duclos for a laminate consisting of three layers called “Gutta-percha fabric”. In 1845 Hancock and Bewley formed the Gutta-percha company in United Kingdom. There were even jewels and ornaments made of it as they were considered to be precious materials at that time.',\n",
       " 'Back in the 19th century, the telegraph was revolutionising the way people communicated. The solution was to lay down undersea telegraph cables. However, to carry electricity an undersea cable needs to be protected and no one had succeeded in doing that. Rubber had been tried as an insulating layer for the cables but marine animals and plants just attacked it, and once the cable was open to the sea it became useless for sending signals. Gutta-percha on the other hand is a great insulator but it doesn’t degrade in seawater. As it was the only known material that worked, soon all marine cable used Gutta-percha and as a result the British businessmen who controlled its supply became very rich.\\nEarly golf balls were filled with feathers. In 1848 Robert Adams Paterson came up with the idea of making them out of Gutta-percha since it was much easier to make than the laborious process of sewing balls of feathers. It was quickly realised, that after they had been used a few times they would fly further. It turned out this was due to the dimples that were made in the balls each time they were hit. The dimples improved the aerodynamics of the ball. That’s why modern golf balls are intentionally covered in dimples. The era of Gutta-percha golf balls lasted from 1845-1903, till the introduction of natural rubber.\\nIn medicine, they were used as splints for holding fractured joints and manufacture of handles of forceps, catheters, etc. It was earlier used to control hemorrhage in extracted socket wounds. They were also used for skin diseases by the dermatologists, particularly against Small pox, Erysipelas, Psoriasis and Eczema.\\nIn India the species of this genus is very scanty. The species found are Palaquium obavatum, Palaquium polyanthum, Palaquium ellipticum and Palaquium gutta trees in Assam and Western ghats. Palaquium gutta was recently introduced and planted in Botanical gardens, Bangalore.\\n---',\n",

Even though it is the closest thing to an ideal root-canal filling material, it is hard to work with, and sometimes it still leaks. Developing a better material is what’s on the horizon. Indeed, the big dental-supply firm Dentsply International, based in York, Pa., is working on a synthetic replacement for gutta-percha that it hopes to introduce in the near future. The final retirement of a historical material with a magnificent name seems too sad to contemplate. So gutta-percha revolutionised global communications, changed the game of golf and even helped people with rotting teeth.

The gutta-percha is melted in the chamber of the device and injected into the canal starting apically and proceeding coronally. This is known as “backfilling” (9).\\nThere are many such devices available in the market. The Obtura III (5), Calamus, Elements, HotShot (6), and Ultrafil 3D are examples of such devices. The Obtura III system heats the gutta-percha to 160 °C, whereas the Ultrafil 3D system employs a low-temperature gutta-percha that is heated to 90 °C.',\n",
       " 'The Obtura III system (Obtura Spartan) consists of a hand-held “gun” that contains a chamber surrounded by a heating element into which pellets of gutta-percha are loaded. Silver needles (varying gauges of 20, 23, and 25) are attached to deliver the thermoplasticized material to the canal. The control unit allows the operator to adjust the temperature and thus the viscosity of the gutta-percha.\\nThe difficulties with this system include lack of length control. Both overextension (11) and underextension can occur. To overcome this drawback, a hybrid technique may be used, in which the clinician begins filling the canal by the lateral compaction technique. When the master cone and several accessory cones have been placed so that the mass is firmly lodged in the apical portion of the canal, a hot plugger is introduced, searing the points off approximately 4 to 5 mm from the apex. Light vertical compaction is applied to restore the integrity of the apical plug of gutta-percha. The remainder of the canal is then filled with thermoplasticized gutta-percha injected as previously described.\\n---\\nAt raised temperatures, gutta-percha behaves like other plastic materials (thermoplastic), softening above 65 °C, melting at 100 °C, and in the a-form beyond 160 °C without decomposing while remaining soft and fluid.\\n- Rotary instruments like NiTi (Protaper retreatment series)\\n- Gutta-percha solvents like Chloroform or xylol\\n- Thermosoftening.\\n- It is compactible and adapts excellently to the irregularities and contour of the canal by the lateral and vertical condensation method.\\n- It can be softened and made plastic by heat or by organic solvents (eucalyptol, chloroform, xylol, turpentine).\\n- It is inert.\\n- It is dimensional stable; when unaltered by organic solvents, it will not shrink.\\n- It is tissue tolerant (nonallergenic).\\n- It will not discolor the tooth structure.\\n- It is radiopaque.\\n- It can be easily removed from the canal when retreatment is indicated.',\n",

The smallest, standardized gutta-percha cones are relatively more difficult to use unless canals are enlarged above size no. 25.\\n- It lacks adhesive quality. Gutta-percha does not adhere to the canal walls; consequently, a sealer is required. The necessary use of a cementing agent introduces the risk of tissue-irritating sealers.\\n- Gutta-percha does not bond to any sealers.\\n- It can be easily displaced by pressure.\\n- Gutta-percha is almost wholly dependent on a coronal seal to prevent the apical migration of bacteria if it is challenged by coronal leakage.\\nA.

The primer penetrates all the dentinal tubules. The bonding procedure is preceded by irrigating with a 17% solution of EDTA. This last process is necessary for removing oxide radicals from the NaOCl and peroxides irrigants. Failure to do so can interfere with the curing of the dentin bonding agent.\\n# Sealer',\n",
       " '# Sealer\\nThe sealer bonds to the primer thereby eliminating potential for microleakage. The sealer used in this system is a dual cure bis-GMA, ethoxylated bis-GMA, UDMA, hydrophilic difunctional methacrylate. Fillers like calcium hydroxide, barium sulphate and barium glass are present 7% by weight. It contains the catalyst that initiates curing of self-etching primer in the dentinal tubules.\\n# Obturator\\nThe Resilon obturator is a thermoplastic polyester and contains bioactive glass, barium sulfate, and bismuth oxychloride. The bioglass forms calcium/phosphate when in contact with body fluid, releasing ions to stimulate the formulation of osseous tissue. It has better radiopacity than gutta-percha, condenses laterally and vertically like gutta-percha, and softens at around 70 to 85 °C. The Resilon obturator bonds to the surface of the sealer which in turn bonds to the primer that has hybridized with the tubular surfaces.\\n# Thinning Resin\\nIn addition to the above, many systems include a thinning resin, which may be added to thin the sealer to the desired viscosity.\\n# Paste-Type Obturating Materials\\nVarious paste-type products have been tried as the sole obturating materials because they have sufficient volume stability to maintain a seal. These include zinc oxide-eugenol based pastes, epoxy resins (AH-26), AH-Plus, Ketac-Endo, polyvinyl resins (Diaket), calcium hydroxide, etc. Many of these are dual use, i.e. they may be used as sole obturating material or as sealer (when combined with gutta-percha).\\n# Disadvantages\\n1. Removal of a hard set cement can be a challenge if retreatment is required.\\n2. Risk of microleakage when used as the sole obturating material.\\nBecause of these inherent problems, use of a hard setting non-thermoplastic, non-soluble cement type filling material as the sole obturating material is not routinely recommended.\\n---\\n# ROOT CANAL SEALERS',\n",
       " '---\\n# ROOT CANAL SEALERS\\nThe sealer plays an important role in the obturation of root canal. Gutta-percha cannot entirely obliterate the spaces within the root canal because of its physical limitations. The sealer fills all the spaces, the gutta-percha is unable to fill. Factors like the shape of the canal, defects within the canal, internal resorption, iatrogenic damage, accessory canals, etc., make intimate sealing of the root canal system a challenging task. A total hermetic seal of the root canal system is necessary to prevent the ingress of bacteria and reinfection of the canal. The sealer also acts as a binding agent, to the dentin and to the core material, which usually is gutta-percha.\\n1. It should be tacky when mixed.\\n2. It should adhere well to the gutta-percha and the canal wall when set.\\n3. It should make a hermetic seal.\\n4. It should be radiopaque so that it can be visualized in the radiograph.\\n5. The particles should be very fine so that they can mix easily with the liquid.\\n6. It should not shrink upon setting.\\n7. It should not stain tooth structure.\\n8. It should be bacteriostatic.\\n9. It should set slowly to provide suitable working time.\\n10. It should be insoluble in tissue fluids.\\n11.

       " '---\\nThere is an initial degenerative response in the immediate vicinity followed rapidly by a mineralization and ossification response.\\nThe alkaline pH of calcium hydroxide neutralizes lactic acid from osteoclasts and prevents dissolution of mineralized components of teeth. This pH also activates alkaline phosphatase that plays an important role in hard tissue formation.\\nCalcium hydroxide denatures proteins found in the root canal.\\nCalcium hydroxide activates the calcium-dependent adenosine triphosphatase reaction associated with hard tissue formation.\\nCalcium hydroxide diffuses through dentinal tubules and may communicate with the periodontal ligament space to arrest external root resorption and accelerate healing.\\n# Setting of Calcium Hydroxide-Based Sealers in Root Canals\\nThe setting time of calcium hydroxide-based sealers in the root canal is dependent upon the availability of moisture. The setting reaction can progress very quickly even in canals which have been inadequately dried. The amount of moisture required for the setting reaction reaches the root canal by means of the dentinal tubules. The material begins to set at the apex, as dentin is thinnest in this region and the apical foramen admits additional moisture.\\n# CRCs (Calcibiotic Root Canal Sealer)\\nCRCs is essentially a ZOE/eucalyptol sealer to which calcium hydroxide has been added for its called osteogenic effect. CRCs takes 3 days to set fully in either dry or humid environments. It also shows very little water sorption. This means it is quite stable, which improves its sealant qualities, but brings into question its ability to stimulate cementum and/or bone formation. If the calcium hydroxide is not released from the cement, it cannot exert an osteogenic effect, and thus its intended role is negated.\\n# Sealapex\\nSealapex is a zinc oxide based calcium hydroxide sealer containing polymeric resin.

At the time the material itself was relatively new as Portland cement was invented in 1824. Mineral trioxide aggregate (MTA) was first described in modern dental scientific literature in 1995. It was developed at Loma Linda University, California, USA, by Torabinejad and Dean White who subsequently obtained two US patents for this Portland cement-based endodontic material, which became known as mineral trioxide aggregate (MTA). Since then, over 20 patents have been issued in the USA and the EU for materials that include Portland cement for dentistry. The term mineral trioxide aggregate (MTA) was coined from the three oxides present in Portland cement namely, calcia, silica and alumina (CaO, SiO2 and Al2O3). Furthermore, the powder particles of cement are in aggregate form.\\n---\\nMineral trioxide aggregate materials are indicated for various restorative, endodontic, and regenerative dental procedures.\\n- Vital pulp therapy (pulp capping and pulpotomy)\\n- Apexification\\n- Perforation repair (lateral and furcation) (Figs. 13.22A and B)\\n- Root-end filling\\n- Internal bleaching\\n- Resorption repair\\n- As sealer and as obturating material (partial or complete).\\nThe first commercially available product was a gray mineral trioxide aggregate, marketed as ProRoot® MTA (Dentsply) (23A).

These include Endo CPM Sealer (EGEO SRL, Argentina), MTA Obtura (Angelus, Brazil), MTA Fillapex (Angelus) (23B), Endocem MTA (Maruchi, Korea) and ProRoot Endo Sealer (Dentsply Maillefer, Switzerland).\\n|A|B|\\n|---|---|',\n",

Further studies comparing the two showed the cements to have similar constituent elements. However, some differences were also noted. The prime difference between the two is the addition of radiopaque fillers to enable radiographic differentiation. Secondly, MTA manufactured for dental use have to pass FDA regulations to enable it to be used in humans, thus components considered harmful have to be eliminated or minimized. A comparison of the two are presented in Table 13.2.\\n---\\n|MTA|Portland cement|\\n|---|---|\\n|Radiopaque fillers|Present|Absent|\\n|Tricalcium aluminate|Present|Absent|\\n|Tricalcium silicate|Lower levels|Higher level|\\n|Calcium sulphate hemihydrate|Absent|Present|\\n|Particle size|Fine|Coarser|\\n|Heavy metal content|Minimal or absent|Present|',\n",

The polymer did not seem to affect the biocompatibility of the materials and the hydration characteristics were similar to those reported for MTA. Sealers based on MTA have been reported to be biocompatible, stimulate mineralization, and encourage apatite-like crystalline deposits along the apical- and middle-thirds of canal walls. These materials exhibited higher push-out strengths after storage in simulated body fluid and had similar sealing properties to epoxy resin-based sealer when evaluated using the fluid filtration system. Fluoride-doped MTA demonstrated stable sealing up to 6 months, and was significantly better than conventional MTA sealers and comparable to AH Plus. The study supports the suitability of MTA sealers in association with warm GP for root filling.\\nThe powder liquid ratio of MTA can vary according to its intended use. For use as a sealer a creamy consistency is preferred. For use in perforation repair a putty consistency may be preferred. P/L therefore ranges from 4 to 1 to 2 to 1.\\nOpen a pouch of ProRoot MTA root repair material and dispense the powder onto a mixing pad. Liquid from the ampoule squeeze out onto the mixing pad next to the powder. Gradually incorporate the liquid into the cement with a plastic spatula.',\n",
       " 'Mix the material with the liquid for about one minute to ensure all the powder particles are hydrated. If needed (one extra ampoule is provided, sterile water can also be used), one or two drops of liquid can be added to make the material into a thick, creamy consistency.\\nThe ProRoot MTA root repair material will set over a period of four hours, but the working time is about five minutes. If more working time is needed, cover the mixed material with a moist gauze pad to prevent evaporation.\\nTraditionally these materials generally have long setting times. Newer products currently being marketed have shorter setting times. Examples include Endocem MTA and Biodentine.\\n| |ProRoot MTA|Endocem MTA|Biodentine|\\n|---|---|---|---|\\n|Initial setting time|165 minutes|2 minutes| |\\n|Final setting time|4 to 6 hours|4 minutes|9–12 minutes|\\n---\\nIt has also been stated that the faster setting time is achieved by increasing particle size, adding calcium chloride to the liquid component, and decreasing the liquid content.\\nMTA sets through a hydration reaction when mixed with water.\\nWhen MTA is mixed with water a highly alkaline (pH 12) cement matrix comprising of calcium hydroxide and calcium silicate hydrate is formed. A setting expansion of 0.1% is seen which contributes to its sealing ability. An acidic environment does not interfere with the setting of the MTA.\\nIt has been shown that once it is set, it has a compressive strength equal to IRM and Super EBA but less than amalgam. Compressive strength of MTA within 24 hours of mixing was about 40.0 MPa and increases to 67.3 MPa after 21 days. In comparison gray MTA exhibited greater compressive strength than white MTA.\\nSet MTA exhibits a low setting expansion of less than 0.1%.\\nMTA is less radio opaque than IRM, amalgam or gutta-percha and has similar radiodensity as Zinc Oxide Eugenol. The mean radiopacity of MTA is 7.17 mm of equivalent thickness of aluminium, which is sufficient to make it easy to visualize radiographically.',\n",
       " 'Although the set MTA shows no signs of solubility, the solubility might increase if more water is used during mixing. The set MTA when exposed to water releases calcium hydroxide is responsible for its cementogenic property.\\nThis property is most vital for any restorative material especially when used for root end filling, repair of perforations, pulp capping or pulpotomy procedures. Bates et al found MTA superior to the other traditional root-end filling materials. MTA expands during setting which may be the reason for its excellent sealing ability. According to Torabinejad et al MTA seals very superiorly and no gaps were found in any of the experimental specimen. However, amalgam, Super EBA and IRM exhibited gaps ranging from 3.8 to 14.9 microns. MTA has also proved itself to be superior in the bacterial leakage test by not allowing the entry of bacteria at the interface. MTA thickness of about 4 mm is sufficient to provide a good seal.\\nTorabinejad et al reported that MTA shows no antimicrobial activity against any of the anaerobes but have some effect on five (S. mitis, S. mutans, S. salivarius, Lactobacillus and S. epidermidis) of the nine facultative bacteria. Since most of the flora in the root canal are strict anaerobic bacteria with few facultative anaerobes, MTA may not be beneficial as a direct antibacterial in endodontic practice. However, it can be proclaimed as an antibacterial agent only by virtue of providing a good seal and preventing micro leakage.',\n",
       " 'MTA does not react or interfere with any other restorative material. Glass Ionomer cements or composite resins, used as permanent filling material do not affect the setting of MTA when placed over it. Residual calcium hydroxide may interfere with the adaptation of MTA to dentin thereby reducing its sealing ability either by acting as a mechanical obstacle or by chemically reacting with MTA. This may be important when calcium hydroxide is placed in the cavity in between the appointments prior to the placement of MTA.\\n---\\ncells after treatment of peripheral lymphocytes with MTA showed no DNA damage. On direct contact they produce minimal or no inflammatory reaction in soft tissues and in fact are capable of inducing tissue regeneration.\\n# Tissue regeneration\\nMTA is capable of activation of cementoblasts and production of cementum. It consistently allows for the overgrowth of cementum and also facilitates regeneration of the periodontal ligament. MTA allows bone healing and eliminates clinical symptoms in many cases. In animal studies, MTA produced cementum growth which was very unique compared to other root-end filling materials. Arens and Torabinejad reported osseous repair of furcation perforations treated with MTA. MTA showed good interaction with bone-forming cells. Investigations by Koh et al revealed that MTA offers a biologically active substrate for bone cells and stimulates interleukin production. MTA is also said to stimulate cytokine production in human osteoblasts.\\n# Mineralization',\n",
       " '# Mineralization\\nMTA, just like calcium hydroxide, induces dentin bridge formation and is believed to be due to its sealing property, biocompatibility, alkalinity and other associated properties. Tricalcium oxide in MTA reacts with tissue fluids to form calcium hydroxide, resulting in hard-tissue formation in a manner similar to that of calcium hydroxide cement. In comparison the dentin bridge formed with MTA is faster, thicker with good structural integrity and more complete than with calcium hydroxide. MTA also proves to be better at stimulating reparative dentin formation and maintaining the integrity of the pulp.\\nPowder form MTA pouches must be kept tightly closed and stored in a dry area to avoid degradation by moisture. ProRoot MTA root repair material must be placed intraorally immediately after mixing with liquid, to prevent dehydration during setting. Excess water will retard curing process. Excess moisture in cotton pellets should be held to a minimum. The area should not be irrigated after placement of the material.',\n",

Obturate all the canal space, apical to the perforation. The material is prepared according to the manufacturers instruction. Using the carrier, dispense the material into the perforation site. Condense the material into the perforation site using a small plugger, cotton pellets or paper points. Confirm placement material with a radiograph.

It is used to reproduce the form of the teeth and surrounding tissues. The negative reproduction of the tissues given by the impression material is filled up with dental stone or other model materials to get a positive cast. The positive reproduction of a single tooth is described as a ‘die’, and when several teeth or a whole arch is reproduced, it is called a ‘cast’ or ‘model’. The application of dental impression compound has also decreased with the increased use of rubber impression materials, which can also be electroformed to produce metal dies. However, impression compound is useful for checking cavity preparations for undercuts and for making impressions of full crown.\\n# ADVANTAGES OF USING A CAST OR MODEL\\n1. Models provide a three-dimensional view of the oral structures, thus aiding in diagnosis and treatment planning.\\n2. Many restorations or appliances are best constructed on casts. It may be inconvenient to both dentist and patient if these have to be made directly in the patient’s mouth.\\n3. Models can be used to educate the patient.\\n4. They serve as treatment records.\\n5.

Therefore these materials are best suited for edentulous mouth. Impression materials used for dentulous mouths On the other hand alginates and rubber base impressions are sufficiently elastic to be withdrawn from undercut areas. Such elastic impression materials are suitable for impressions for fabrication of removable and fixed partial denture prostheses, where the impressions of the ridge and teeth are required.\\n# RIGID IMPRESSION MATERIALS\\n(Impression plaster is described in the chapter on Gypsum Products).\\n# IMPRESSION COMPOUND\\nImpression compound is one of the oldest of the dental impression materials. It can be described as a rigid, reversible impression material which sets by physical change. On applying heat, it softens and on cooling it hardens. It is mainly used for making impressions of edentulous ridges. A more viscous variety of compound called tray compound is used to form a tray in which a second more fluid material is placed to make a more detailed impression compound.\\nSynonyms Modeling compound or modeling plastic.\\n# CLASSIFICATION',\n",
       " 'Synonyms Modeling compound or modeling plastic.\\n# CLASSIFICATION\\nType I - Impression compound Type II - Tray compound Type II Tray compound is used to prepare a tray for making an impression. A second material is then carried in it in order to make an impression of oral tissues. Since reproduction of the fine details is not essential, it is generally stiffer and has less flow than regular impression compound. The use of dental tray compound decreased with the increased substitution of acrylic tray materials.\\n# SUPPLIED AS\\nSupplied as sheets, sticks, cakes and cones in a variety of colors (1).\\n---\\n# 1\\nImpression compound cakes and sticks.\\n# APPLICATIONS\\n- For making a preliminary impression in an edentulous mouth (mouth without teeth).\\n- For impressions of full crown preparations where gingival tissues must be displaced.\\n- Peripheral tracing or border molding.\\n- To check undercuts in inlay preparation.\\n- To make a special tray.\\nSingle tooth impression: In conservative dentistry, an impression is made of a single tooth in which a cavity is prepared. The compound is softened and carried in a copper band. The filled band is pressed over the tooth and the compound flows into the prepared cavity. It is referred to as a tube impression. Tube impressions were also used to make electroformed dies.\\nComplete denture impressions: In complete denture fabrication, it is common to make two sets of impressions—the preliminary and the final impression. The preliminary impression is made in a stock tray. A study cast made from this is used to construct a custom tray or special tray. The custom tray is used to make the final impression. The technique of making a preliminary and final impression greatly improves the accuracy of the complete denture.\\n# REQUIREMENTS OF IMPRESSION COMPOUND\\n1.

Should not boil and lose volatile components on flaming.\\n12. Should remain stable without losing soluble plasticizers when immersed in water for long periods.\\n# COMPOSITION\\nIn general impression compound is a mixture of waxes, thermoplastic resins, organic acids, fillers and coloring agents.\\n|Ingredient|Parts|\\n|---|---|\\n|Resin|30|\\n|Copal resin|30|\\n|Carnauba wax|10|\\n|Stearic acid|5|\\n|Talc|25|\\n|Coloring agent (e.g. rouge)| |\\nPlasticizers Compounds, such as shellac, stearic acid and gutta-percha are added to improve plasticity and workability. These substances are referred to as plasticizers. Synthetic resins are being used in increasing amounts. Waxes and resin give the material its characteristic thermoplastic properties.\\nFillers These are small particles of inert materials which strengthen or improve the physical properties of many materials. Fillers are chemically different from the principal ingredient. In such a case the filler particles are sometimes referred to as the core and the surrounding ingredients as the matrix. For example, the waxes and resins in impression compound impart high flow and low strength. Consequently, a filler such as talc is added to reduce the plasticity and increase strength of the matrix material. Other fillers used are diatomaceous earth, soap stone and French chalk.\\n# PROPERTIES OF IMPRESSION COMPOUND',\n",
       " '# PROPERTIES OF IMPRESSION COMPOUND\\nWhen impression compound is heated in a hot water bath the material starts to soften at approximately 39 °C. However at this stage, it is still not plastic or soft enough for making an impression. This temperature at which the material looses its hardness or brittleness on heating or forms a rigid mass upon cooling is referred to as fusion temperature. Impression compound exhibits a fusion temperature range rather than a fixed point.\\nOn continued heating above 43.5 °C, the material continues to soften and flow to a plastic mass that can be manipulated. Thus all impressions with compound should be made above this temperature. Below this temperature an accurate impression cannot be expected.\\n---\\n# Thermal conductivity\\nImpression compound has very low thermal conductivity, i.e. they are poor conductors of heat.\\n# Significance\\n- During softening of the material, the outside will soften first and the inside last. So to ensure uniform softening the material should be kept immersed for a sufficient period in a water bath. Kneading of the material ensures further uniform softening.\\n- The low thermal conductivity affects the cooling rate. The layer adjacent to the oral tissues cools faster than the inside. Removal of the impression at this stage can cause serious distortion. Thus it is important to wait for the compound to cool thoroughly before removing it from the mouth.\\n# Coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE)\\nThe CTE of compound is comparatively high due to the presence of resins and waxes. The linear contraction from mouth temperature to room temperature is 0.3%.\\n# Errors from thermal distortion can be reduced\\n- By obtaining an impression and then passing the impression over a flame until the surface is softened and then obtaining a second impression. During the second impression, the shrinkage is relatively lower, since only the surface layer has been softened.',\n",
       " '- Another way of reducing the thermal contraction is by spraying cold water on the metal tray just before it is inserted in the mouth. Thus the material adjacent to the tray will be hardened, while the surface layer is still soft. In both techniques, the impression is likely to be stressed considerably and so the stone cast should be constructed at the earliest.\\n# FLOW\\nGood flow is desirable during impression making. The softened material should flow into all the details of the tissue contour. Once the compound hardens, it should have minimum flow, otherwise it will get distorted.\\n# Dimensional stability\\nSince the release of strains is unavoidable, the safest way to prevent distortion is to pour the cast immediately or at least within the hour. Another cause of warpage is removal of the impression too early from the mouth before complete hardening.\\n# Detail reproduction\\nSurface detail reproduction is comparatively less because of its high viscosity and low flow. Because of the viscosity, pressure has to be used during impression, which compresses or distorts the tissues. Thus the tissues are recorded in a distorted state.\\n# MANIPULATION\\n# STICKS\\nSmall amounts of compound (stick compound) can be softened over a flame. When a direct flame is used, the compound should not be allowed to boil or ignite, otherwise, the plasticizers are volatilized.\\n---\\nLarger amounts of compound are softened in warm water in a thermostatically controlled water bath (3) usually in the range of 65 to 75 °C. After the compound is removed from the water bath, it is usually kneaded with the fingers in order to obtain uniform plasticity throughout the mass.',\n",
       " 'A slightly oversized tray is selected. The softened material is loaded onto the tray and quickly seated on to the tissues to be recorded (Figs. 14.4 to 14.6). Any delay can cause the impression to harden prematurely. If the compound is too hot, it may be tempered by briefly immersing in slightly cooler water. The lips are manipulated to mold the borders of the impression while it is still soft.\\n1. Prolonged immersion in a water bath causes the compound to become brittle and grainy because some of the ingredients may be leached out.\\n2. Overheating in water makes the compound sticky and difficult to handle.\\n3. Avoid incorporating water while kneading.\\nThe impression is removed from the mouth only after it has completely cooled and hardened.\\n2 Manipulation of stick compound for border molding of a custom tray.\\n3 A thermostatically controlled water bath.

The cast is separated from the impression by immersing it in warm water until it is soft enough. Excessively hot water is avoided as it can make the material sticky and difficult to remove from the cast.\\n# ADVANTAGES AND DISADVANTAGES\\n# ADVANTAGES\\n1. The material can be reused a number of times (for the same patient only) in case of errors.\\n2. Inaccurate portions can be remade without having to remake the entire impression.\\n3. Accuracy can be improved by flaming the surface.\\n4. The material has sufficient body to support itself especially in the peripheral portions.

The chelate is thought to form as an amorphous gel that tends to crystallize, giving strength to the set mass. Formation of crystalline zinc eugenolate is greatly enhanced by zinc acetate dehydrate (accelerator) which is more soluble than Zn(OH)2 and can supply zinc ions more rapidly.\\n# SETTING TIME\\nWorking time: There should be sufficient time for mixing, loading onto the tray, and seating the impression into the mouth.\\nSetting time: Once the material is in place, it should set fast.\\n---\\nAny material which takes a long time to set in the mouth would obviously be uncomfortable to the patient. Movement is bound to occur, resulting in stresses and errors in the impression, which can lead to a wastage of time for the dentist. In a busy practice, this is unacceptable. Initial setting time is the period from the beginning of the mixing until the material ceases to pull away or string out when its surface is touched with a metal rod of specified dimensions. The impressions should be seated in the mouth before the initial set. The final set occurs when a needle of specified dimension fails to penetrate the surface of the specimen more than 0.2 mm under a load of 50 gm.\\n| |Initial setting time|Final setting time|\\n|---|---|---|\\n|Type I|3–6 minutes|10 minutes|\\n|Type II|3–6 minutes|15 minutes|\\n1.

The process of collecting and flattening is repeated alternately until a uniform mix is obtained. Mechanical mixing gives a faster, uniform mix with less voids and bubbles.\\n11: Mechanical mixer.\\n# IMPRESSION TRAY\\nCustom impression tray made of stable resin is recommended for zinc oxide eugenol.

Teeth or severe undercuts if present, would make the removal of such impressions difficult. The impression could distort or fracture on removal. The ideal impression material for accurately reproducing tooth form and relationship would be an elastic substance which can be withdrawn from the undercut area and return to its original form without any distortion. By definition, an elastic impression material is one that can transform from a semisolid, nonelastic state to a highly elastic solid state.\\n---\\n# HYDROCOLLOIDS',\n",
       " '---\\n# HYDROCOLLOIDS\\nIn a solution (e.g. sugar in water) one substance, usually a solid is dispersed in another, usually a liquid and the two phases are microscopically indistinguishable. Thus, a solution exists as a single phase because there is no separation between the solute and the solvent. A suspension on the other hand, consists of larger particles that can be seen under a microscope or even by the naked eye, dispersed in a medium. Similarly, liquid distributed in liquids are emulsions. Suspensions and emulsions are two phase systems.\\n- Dispersed phase or dispersed particle (the suspended particle).\\n- Dispersion phase or medium (the substance in which it is suspended).\\n- Liquid or solid in air (Aerosol)\\n- Gas, liquid or solid in liquid (Lyosol)\\n- Gas, liquid or solid in solid.\\nThey consist of gelatin particles suspended in water (Lyosol). Since water is the dispersion medium it is known as hydrocolloid. The particles are larger than those in solutions and size ranges from 1 to 200 nanometers (1 nm = 10–9 m). There is no clear demarcation between solutions, colloids, and suspensions (emulsions).\\nColloids with a liquid as the dispersion medium can exist in two different forms known as ‘sol’ and ‘gel’. A sol has the appearance and many characteristics of a viscous liquid. A gel is a jelly-like elastic semisolid and is produced from a sol by a process called gelation by the formation of fibrils or chains or micelles of the dispersed phase which become interlocked. Gelation is thus the conversion of a sol to gel. The dispersion medium is held in the interstices between the fibrils by capillary attraction or adhesion.\\n1.

Types of hydrocolloids.\\n|Reversible hydrocolloids|They are called reversible because their physical state can be reversed. This makes them reusable.|\\n|---|---|\\n|Irreversible hydrocolloids|Once these set, it is usually permanent, and so are known as irreversible.|\\nIn 1925, Alphous Poller of Vienna was granted a British patent for a totally different type of impression material. It is said that Poller’s objective was to develop a material that could be sterilized and applied without pressure to the exposed surface of the dura mater for perfectly recording its convulsion and the bony margins of the skull. Later Poller’s Negacol was modified and introduced to the dental profession as Dentacol in 1928.\\nAgar hydrocolloid was the first successful elastic impression material to be used in dentistry. It is an organic hydrophilic colloid (polysaccharide) extracted from a type of seaweed (Gelidium, Gracilaria, etc. Box 15.1 and 1). China and South America are major sources of farmed seaweed.\\nAgar is a sulfuric ester of a linear polymer of galactose. Although it is an excellent impression material and yields accurate impressions, presently it has been largely replaced by alginate hydrocolloid and rubber impression materials.\\n|Type 1|Heavy bodied (for use as tray material)|\\n|---|---|\\n|Type 2|Medium bodied (for use as tray or syringe material)|\\n|Type 3|Light bodied (for syringe use only)|\\n|Type 3A|Light bodied for agar-alginate combination technique|',\n",

As the agar sol cools the dispersed phase groups to form fibrils called micelles. The fibrils branch and intermesh together to form a brush-heap structure. The fibrils form weak covalent bonds with each other which break easily at higher temperatures resulting in gel turning to sol. The process of converting gel to sol is known as liquefaction which occurs at a temperature between 70 and 100 °C. On cooling agar reverses to the gel state and the process is called gelation. Gelation occurs at or near mouth temperature which is necessary to avoid injury to oral tissues.\\nThe gelling property of agar-agar is due to the three equatorial hydrogen atoms on the 3,6-anhydro-L-galactose residues, which constrain the molecule to form a helix. The interaction of the helixes causes the formation of the gel.\\n- Hydrocolloid conditioner (4F)\\n- Water cooled rim lock trays (Figs. 15.4E and 15.5)\\n- Impression syringes (Figs. 15.3 and 15.4C)\\n- Connecting water hose (4D)\\n- Agar tray material in tubes (4B)\\n- Agar syringe material (Figs. 15.2 and 15.4A)\\n|A|B|C|D|E|F|\\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|\\n|4A to F|Typical equipment and material for an agar impression procedure.| | | | |\\n---\\n|Boiling section or Liquefaction section|Ten minutes in boiling water (100 °C).

This reduces the temperature so that it is tolerated by the sensitive oral tissues. It also makes the material viscous.|\\nRim lock trays with water circulating devices are used. The rim lock is a beading on the inside edge of the tray border which helps to retain the material (as agar does not adhere to the tray). It also has an inlet and outlet for connecting the water tubes (5). The tray should allow a space of 3 mm occlusally and laterally and extend distally to cover all teeth. 5 A water cooled tray.\\nThe tray containing the tempered material is removed from the bath. The outer surface of the agar sol is scraped off, then the water hoses are connected, and the tray is positioned in the mouth by the dentist. Water is circulated at 18–21 °C through the tray until gelation occurs. Rapid cooling (e.g. ice cold water) is not recommended as it can induce distortion. To guide the tray into position, three stops of compound are prepared on non-involved teeth. A post dam is constructed with compound to prevent distal flow of the impression material. In a deep palate case, compound is placed on the palatal aspect of the tray in order to provide a uniform thickness of the hydrocolloid. The mandibular tray is prepared by placing compound on the distal aspect to limit the impression material. Black tray compound is used as it is not affected in the tempering bath.\\nThe working time ranges between 7 minutes and 15 minutes and the setting time is about 5 minutes. Both can be controlled by regulating the flow of water through the cooling tubes. Since the cooling tubes are on the periphery, the material sets from the periphery towards the teeth surfaces.',\n",
       " 'When the agar has gelled, the peripheral seal is broken, and the impression is removed from the mouth rapidly. The impression is rinsed thoroughly with water and the excess water is removed by shaking the impression.\\nStorage of agar impression is to be avoided at all costs. The cast should be poured immediately. Storage in air results in dehydration, and storage in water results in swelling of the impression.\\n---\\nStorage in 100% relative humidity results in shrinkage as a result of continued formation of the agar network agglomeration. If storage is unavoidable, it should be limited to one hour in 100% relative humidity.\\nWhen the gypsum product has set, the agar impression must be removed promptly since the impression will dehydrate, become stiff and difficult to remove. Weaker portions of the model may fracture. In addition, prolonged contact will result in a rougher surface on the model.\\nThe ISO 21563 (2013) sets the standard for properties required of agar–hydrocolloid impression materials.\\nMost materials melt as well as resolidify at pe same temperature. However, in agar, pis does not coincide. Gelation (solidification) occurs at 37 °C approximately, whereas liquefaction (melting) occurs at a higher temperature, i.e. 60–70 °C higher pan pe gelation temperature. This temperature lag between liquefaction and gelation is known as hysteresis.',\n",
       " 'Since hydrocolloids use water as pe dispersion medium, pey are prone for dimensional change due to eiper loss or gain of water. If left in a dry atmosphere, water is lost by syneresis and evaporation, and if it is immersed in water, it absorbs water by a process known as imbibition. The exuding of fluid from pe gel is known as syneresis. Some of pe more soluble constituents are also lost. During syneresis small droplets of exudate are formed on pe surface of pe hydrocolloid and pe process occurs irrespective of pe humidity of pe surrounding atmosphere. Agar exhibits pe properties of syneresis and imbibition. However, when immersed in water, pey do not imbibe more pan original content which was lost by evaporation (unlike alginates). Importance Syneresis and imbibition can result in dimensional changes and perefore inaccurate casts. To avoid pis hydrocolloid impressions should be poured immediately.\\nISO 21532:2013 requires flexibility ranging between 4% and 15%, when a stress of 12.2 N is applied. A few set materials, however, have a flexibility of 20%. On an average a flexibility of 11% is desirable.\\nThey are highly elastic, and elastic recovery occurs to pe extent of 98.8% (ISO 21532:2013 - min. 96.5 %).\\nThe gel can wipstand great stresses particularly shear stress, wipout flow, provided pe stress is applied rapidly. Thus, pe impression should be removed as rapidly as possible in order to avoid distortion. Agar has a tear strengp of 0.8–0.9 kN/m and compressive strengp of 0.5–0.9 g/cm2. (ISO 21532:2013, minimum tear strengp for Type 1 and 2 is 0.75 N/mm; for Type 3 is 0.50 N/mm.) The above values are for tray materials. The syringe materials have poorer mechanical properties.\\n---\\n# Factors affecting strength\\n1. The composition—agar concentration, borate and filler content, etc.\\n2.

If the material is retained well in the tray, the material contracts towards the tray resulting in larger dies. Agar impressions are highly accurate at the time of removal from the mouth, but shrink when stored in air or 100% relative humidity and expand when stored in water. The least dimensional change occurs when the impressions are stored in 100% humidity (for not more than one hour). However, prompt pouring of plaster or stone models is recommended.\\n# LAMINATE TECHNIQUE (AGAR–ALGINATE COMBINATION TECHNIQUE)\\nAfter injecting the syringe agar onto the area to be recorded, an impression tray containing a mix of chilled alginate that will bond with the agar is positioned over it. The alginate gels by a chemical reaction, whereas the agar gels through contact with the cool alginate, rather than the water circulating through the tray.\\n1. The syringe agar gives better details than alginate.\\n2. Less air bubbles.\\n3. Water cooled trays are not required and therefore more convenient.\\n4. It sets faster than the regular agar technique.\\n# WET FIELD TECHNIQUE\\nIn this technique, the areas to be recorded are actually flooded with warm water. Then the syringe material is introduced quickly, liberally, and in bulk to cover the occlusal and/or incisal areas only. While the syringe material is still liquid, the tray material is seated. The hydraulic pressure of the viscous tray materials forces the fluid syringe hydrocolloid down into the areas to be recorded.

Alginic acid is a naturally occurring hydrophilic colloidal polysaccharide. Alginate was developed as a substitute for agar when it became scarce due to World War II (Japan was a prime source of agar). Currently alginate is more popular than agar for dental impressions, because it is simpler to use.

It is a cross-linked structure (i.e. each fiber is tied to each other at certain points). Calcium is responsible for cross-linking.\\nAlginate has a pleasant taste and smell. Over the years, manufacturers have added a variety of colors, odors and tastes to make it as pleasant as possible to the patient. Flavors include strawberry, orange, mint, vanilla, etc.\\nIt is about 14% at a stress of 12.2 N. However, some of the hard set materials have lower values (5–8%). Lower W/P ratio (thick mixes) results in lower flexibility (ISO 21563:2013—minimum requirement ranges from 5 to 20%).\\nAlginate hydrocolloids are highly elastic (but less when compared to agar) and about 98.2% elastic recovery occurs. Thus, permanent deformation is more for alginate (about 1.8%). Permanent deformation is less if the set impression is removed from the mouth quickly.\\nDetail reproduction is also lower when compared to agar hydrocolloid.

When placed in contact with water, alginates absorb water and swell (Figs. 15.11A and B). Continued immersion in water results in the total disintegration of the alginate.\\nSet alginates have poor dimensional stability due to evaporation, syneresis, and imbibition. Therefore, the cast should be poured immediately. If storage is unavoidable, keeping in a humid atmosphere of 100% relative humidity (humidor) results in the least dimensional change. Alginates can also be stored in sealed plastic bags. Modern alginates, both regular and extended pour varieties, have shown to have good clinically acceptable dimensional stability for periods ranging from 1 to 5 days according to some studies (Box 15.2).\\nNo known chemical or allergic reactions have been identified for alginate.

       " '---\\n# Box 15.2 Extended pour alginates\\nTraditionally alginates were considered to be dimensional unstable. For decades, dental professionals were taught that casts should be generated from alginate impressions immediately or within 60 minutes after the impression is removed from the patient’s mouth. Studies have challenged these assumptions for currently available alginates (J Am Dent Assoc 2010;141;32-39). Many alginates today are marketed with manufacturers claiming good dimensional stability for up to 5 days (Hydrogum 5). These are known as extended pour alginates. Dimensional stability over a longer period is desirable for transportation of alginate impressions to distant labs. Studies have shown that both conventional and extended pour alginates meet the requirements for dimensionally stability and accuracy for periods ranging from 2 to 5 days under recommended storage conditions.\\n- Alginate impressions must be poured as soon as possible. If it becomes necessary to store the impression, the following methods may be used:\\n- Wrap the impression lightly with a moist paper towel and cover with a rubber bowl, or\\n- Keep the impression in a sealed plastic bag.\\nNote: Even under these conditions storage should not be done for more than one hour (Box 15.2). Care should be taken not to use a soaking wet paper towel or gauze as it can cause imbibition of water.\\n- Reduce the trapping of air bubbles.\\n- Remove the water-rich surface layer which can result in a weaker cast surface.\\nThe impression is filled with the remaining stone and placed aside to set.

       " '- Because of these drawbacks and the availability of better materials, it is not recommended where a higher degree of accuracy is required, e.g. cast RPD, crowns and FDPs, etc. (Box 15.3).\\nBecause of their low cost alginates are often used to make final impressions during the fabrication of high precision restorations like RPDs, crowns and FPDs. Although they are reasonably accurate, they have a few properties which make them inferior to elastomeric materials. These include lower dimensional stability, poor tear strength, lower detail reproduction, etc. Some clinics process their impressions in distant laboratories which then involves a period of delay before it can be cast in stone. Alginate impressions are inaccurate if pouring is delayed. For these reason alginates are not recommended where high levels of accuracy is required, especially where it has to be withdrawn over severe undercuts (as in dentate subjects) and where very thin areas which can tear easily are present (gingival margins).\\n---\\n# Chapter 16\\n# Elastomeric Impression Materials\\n# Chapter Outline\\n- Chemistry of Elastomers\\n- Types\\n- Addition Silicones (Poly Vinyl Siloxane)\\n- Impression Techniques\\n- Monophase) Technique\\n- Dual-phase) Technique\\n- Two-stage Putty-wash Technique\\n- (One-stage Putty-wash Technique\\n- Uses of Elastomeric Impression Materials\\n- Supplied as\\n- General Properties of Elastomeric Materials\\n- Polyether Rubber Impression Material\\n- Removal of the Impression\\n- Infection Control\\n- Impression Errors\\n- Air Entrapment\\n- Seating Voids\\n- Fluid Entrapment and Fluid Trails\\n- Effect of Provisional Crown Materials\\n- Specialized Elastomers\\n- Bite Registration Silicones\\n- Fit Checking Silicones\\n- Duplicating Silicones',\n",

These were called vulcanite as they were converted into rubber from their natural latex by a process called vulcanization. The first elastomeric or rubber-based ‘impression material’ to be introduced was polysulfide which was introduced in 1950. Interestingly, they were originally developed as an industrial sealant for gaps between concrete structures. This was followed by condensation silicone in 1955, polyether in 1965 and the addition silicones in 1975.\\nIntroduction of the elastomers were a considerable technological advance in the quality of dental services. Elastomers are soft and rubber-like and far more stronger and stable than the hydrocolloids. They are known as synthetic rubbers. The ADA Sp. No. 19 referred to them as nonaqueous elastomeric dental impression materials. The term nonaqueous was used to differentiate them from agar and alginate (considered aqueous or water containing materials). Currently ISO 4823 simply refers to them as ‘elastomeric impression materials’. These materials are the most accurate and dimensionally stable impression materials available in dentistry.\\n---\\n# 1A And B\\nDiagrammatic representation of an elastomer.\\n|(A) An unstressed elastomer.|(B) The same elastomer under stress.|\\n|---|---|\\n|When the stress is removed, it will return to configuration A.

Thus elastomers are essentially polymers with elastic or rubber-like properties. Other polymers used in dentistry are the denture and composite resins. Gutta-percha is also a polymer (cis-polyisoprene) which is closely related to natural latex (trans-polyisoprene). Natural latex is currently used in dentistry to manufacture examination gloves and rubber dams. Gutta-percha is used as an endodontic obturation material.\\nElastomeric materials contain large molecules with weak interaction between them. They are tied together at certain points to form a three-dimensional network. On stretching, the chains uncoil, and on removal of the stress they snap back to their relaxed entangled state (Figs. 16.1A and B).\\nElastomers are amorphous polymers existing above their glass transition temperature, so that considerable segmental motion is possible. As a result of this extreme flexibility, elastomers can reversibly extend from 5% to 700%, depending on the specific material.

A streak-free mix is obtained in 45 seconds.\\nUnlike addition silicone, the quantity of catalyst paste needed is very little. The manufacturer usually marks the length required on the mixing pad. The two pastes, therefore, are of unequal length and diameter.',\n",
       " \"The required amount of thinner (when supplied) may be added to the base and accelerator depending on the viscosity needed. Again, like condensation silicone, the quantity of accelerator needed is very little. The ratio is usually displayed on the mixing pad. The mixing should be done quickly. The mixing time is 30 seconds.\\nKneading is primarily employed for very heavy or putty consistency elastomers. In the case of addition silicones, equal scoops of base and accelerator are dispensed. With condensation silicones, the required number of scoops of base and the recommended amount of liquid or paste accelerator is taken. In either case, mixing is done by kneading between the fingers. Mixing is continued until a streak-free mix is obtained.\\nThe technique is similar to that described for zinc oxide impression pastes. The pastes are dispensed onto a rotating table. The spatula is used to scoop and flatten the pastes alternately and continuously as the table rotates until a uniform mix is obtained.\\nStatic mixing, also known as 'extrusion mixing' (ISO 4823:2015), has grown in popularity over the years, primarily because of its high accuracy and convenience. Extrusion mixing is a method by which two or more material components are extruded simultaneously from their separate primary containers through a special mixing tip from which the material components emerge as a homogeneous mixture.\\n1.

Elastomers do not adhere well to the tray. An adhesive (9A) should be applied to the tray and allowed to dry before making impressions. The adhesive cements provided with the various elastomers are not interchangeable. A slightly roughened tray surface will increase the adhesion. For putty impressions, a perforated stock tray is used. The perforations help retain the putty in the tray (9B).\\nIn case of elastomers, the bulk of the impression should be made with a heavier consistency (to reduce shrinkage). Light bodied should only be used in a thin layer as a wash impression.\\n# Classification of Elastomeric Impression Techniques\\n- Dual viscosity technique using light body-heavy bodied\\n- Putty-wash technique\\n|7|Rotary mixing device.| | |\\n|---|---|---|---|\\n|A| |B| |\\n|8A And B|Two representative dynamic mechanical mixing devices.| | |\\n---\\n9A And B Retention of elastomers.

Simple and quick as custom tray is not required.\\n3. Accurate.\\n# Precautions\\nSome clinicians use the preliminary impression as a template to construct a provisional restoration (temporary crown). The same preliminary impression is then relined with the final wash material to make the final impression. If a composite based provisional restorative material [e.g. Protemp 4 (ESPE), Structur (VOCO)] has been used to construct the provisionals, a shiny oily layer called the air or oxygen inhibited layer (OIL) from this material forms a coating over the putty in this region. The OIL can affect both setting as well as bonding of the wash material. This can result in delayed setting, distortion or separation of the wash impression from the preliminary impression. This can be eliminated by rigorously wiping off the OIL or physically removing of a layer of putty with a trimmer.\\n---\\n# ONE-STAGE PuTTY RELINE (ONE-STAGE PuTTY-wASH TECHNIquE)\\n|Tray used|Perforated stock tray.|\\n|---|---|\\n|Viscosity used|(a) Putty and (b) Light body.|',\n",

The technique is simple and quick.\\n# REMOVAL OF THE IMPRESSION\\n- Elastic recovery is better\\n- Tear resistance is higher.\\nHowever, rapid removal may be difficult as well as uncomfortable to the patient. Removal is facilitated by breaking the air-seal. This can be done by teasing the borders of the tray parallel to the path of insertion until the air leaks into the tray. Compressed air through an air syringe may also be used. In addition to holding the tray handle, a finger on the buccal portion of the tray may be used to apply additional pressure to dislodge the tray.\\n# Infection Control\\nRubber impression materials are disinfected by immersing in disinfectant solutions. 10 minutes in 2% glutaraldehyde or 3 minutes in chlorine dioxide solutions have been found to be satisfactory. Because of its tendency to absorb water, a spray of chlorine dioxide is preferred in the case of polyether. Other disinfectants used are phenol and iodophor.\\n# Impression Errors\\nErrors in impressions do occur and can result in inaccurate casts and prostheses.

(B) Impression errors (fluid trails and loss of detail) caused by active bleeding and inadequate fluid control.|\\nVoids occur from a variety of causes.\\n1. Air entrapment due to faulty loading of the tray. Care should be taken when loading the tray. Material should be loaded in a continuous motion from one end of the tray to the other pushing the material ahead as it is ejected from the static mixing device. The tip should be in close proximity to the surface of the tray. Lifting the tip away from the tray and moving it from place to place in a discontinuous motion can result in air entrapment.\\n2. Air entrapment from faulty placement of material around the prepared tooth. When placing the material on the prepared tooth using a syringe or a static mixing tip, the material should be extruded in close proximity to the sulcus and prepared tooth in a continuous motion around the prepared tooth starting from the sulcus and finish line through to the occlusal surface. Discontinuous and erratic motion with lifting of the tip from place to place can result in air entrapment.\\nElastomers with the exception of polyether are generally being hydrophobic require the impression field to be reasonably clean and dry.\\n- Failure to adequately remove water or control saliva in impression field.\\n- Failure to control bleeding and exudate. Continuous bleeding from injured or inflamed soft tissues near the prepared tooth can result in loss of detail and fluid trails as the blood continues to flow (Figs. 16.11A and B).',\n",
       " 'Seating voids or trails are usually seen when using a ‘single stage putty-wash technique’. The putty tends to displace the light bodied resulting in voids or ‘seating trails’ (Figs. 16.12A and B). Seating trails usually correspond to prominent cusps. The void caused by the penetration of the cusp fails to get filled by the wash material because of the displacement. This can cause inaccuracies in the impression especially if it is related to the prepared tooth. Seating trails correspond to the direction of seating. For this reason the single stage putty reline technique is not advocated for procedures requiring a high degree of accuracy. The two-stage technique is superior in this regard.\\n---\\n|A|B|\\n|---|---|\\n|12A And B|(A) Seating trails (arrows) corresponding to the palatal cusps of the maxillary molars result in a significant loss of detail in the impression and the corresponding area of the cast (B).|',\n",

According to one study direct contact of polyvinyl siloxane impression materials to some brands of resin based provisional interim fixed prosthodontic materials resulted in polymerization inhibition (delayed setting). The brands tested included Trim Plus, Unifast, Integrity, Systemp C&B, Tuff-Temp, Protemp IV. Among the elastomers polyether was least affected. Composite based provisional crown materials like Protemp 4 are used to make direct intraoral provisional (temporary crowns). The material is usually placed on to the tooth in a clear vacuum-formed template (suck-down). Some clinicians use a preoperative putty impression as a template. When a provisional crown is made directly in the mouth using a putty impression as a template. An oily coating of resin also known as the oxygen inhibited layer (OIL) remains on the teeth as well as the impression surfaces after separation of the provisional crown. If the operator continues with the final impression by relining the putty impression in which the provisional crown was made without adequate cleansing of the OIL can result in 2 problems. 1. Impaired setting in the area resulting in an inaccurate impression. 2. Failure of the wash impression material to bond to the underlying putty resulting in physically separation from the putty (Figs. 16.13A and B).|',\n",

Many materials are used for this purpose in dentistry. The earliest materials were wax and plaster. A specialized addition type of silicone is increasingly popular as a bite registration material. Unlike the regular impression silicone, these materials show greater stiffness and greater hardness (32–45 Shore D) when set. A faster setting time is also important to reduce errors caused by movement and to reduce discomfort to the patient. Setting time ranges from as low as 20 seconds to a minute depending on the type. Other important properties required of these materials is that they should not slump or drip when initially placed. A scannable version has also been introduced for use in CAD CAM (Virtual CADbite Registration, Ivoclar). Most are supplied in cartridge form for use with a caulking gun. Some are supplied in collapsible tubes. One product (Colorbite D, Zhermack) has thermochromic indicators to help the clinician ascertain setting in the mouth.\\nAnother specialized addition type silicone is used for detecting errors in the internal surface of crowns and fixed partial dentures. They are available as a two-paste system. Small but equal lengths of the two pastes are mixed and applied to the internal surface of the crown. The crown is seated on the tooth and the material allowed to set. Areas of premature contact are revealed as bare areas or areas where the internal surface of the crown is showing through. These areas are marked and reduced. The material can also be used to assess the fit of complete and partial dentures.\\n---\\n# FIT CHECKER\\n|A|B|\\n|---|---|',\n",

They are usually supplied in bulk containers ranging from 250 g to 10 kg.\\nThey are mixed in a ratio of 1:1. The working time ranges from 2 to 5 minutes. The setting time of these materials are comparatively longer ranging from 10 to 30 minutes. Shore hardness of these materials range from 17 to 26.

Such casts are used in the fabrication of certain large metal structures, e.g. cast removable partial dentures. Small wax structures like inlays, crowns, and small FPDs can be constructed on a regular die as it can be removed from the die without significant distortion and invested separately. However, larger wax structures like that for the cast RPD would distort if removed.\\n---\\ntogether with the refractory cast.\\nWhy not invest an ordinary gypsum cast? The conventional (nonrefractory) gypsum cast cannot withstand the high temperatures involved in the casting of metal and would disintegrate under these conditions.\\n# REFRACTORY CAST FOR CERAMICS\\nRefractory dies are also available for ceramic restorations [e.g. polyvest (8) and VHT— Whipmix]. The all-porcelain restoration is directly built up on these refractory dies and fired (further detail in chapter on investments).\\n# DIE STONE-INVESTMENT COMBINATION (DIVESTMENT)\\nThis is a combination of die material and investing medium. A gypsum-bonded material called divestment is mixed with a colloidal silica liquid. A die is prepared from the mix and a wax pattern is constructed on it. Then the wax pattern together with die is invested in divestment. The setting expansion of divestment is 0.9% and thermal expansion 0.6%, when heated to 677 °C. As it is a gypsum-bonded material it is not recommended for high fusing alloys, e.g. metal-ceramic alloys.',\n",
       " 'ADVANTAGE It is a highly accurate technique for conventional gold alloys, especially for extracoronal preparations. In this technique, removal of the wax pattern from the die is not required. Thus, possibility of distortion of wax pattern during removal from the die or during setting of the investment is minimized.\\n# DIVESTMENT PHOSPHATE OR DVP\\nThis is a phosphate-bonded investment that is similar to the divestment and is suitable for use with high fusing alloys.\\nRefractory die material for use in the fabrication of ceramic restorations.\\n---\\nThough both are quite similar, there are some fundamental differences. The investment casts are not as strong and abrasion resistant as the divestment cast. In fact, they are quite fragile and can disintegrate easily. Manufacturers have provided certain hardening solutions to compensate for this. Divestment is generally used for smaller castings, whereas investment refractory casts are used during the fabrication of larger structures, such as partial dentures frames and complete denture bases.\\n---\\n# Chapter 18: Gypsum Products\\n# Chapter Outline\\n- Applications\\n- Theories of Setting\\n- Hardness and Abrasion\\n# Applications\\nProducts of gypsum are used extensively in dentistry.

It is used when high strength and surface hardness is required. Uses include model bases, CAD/CAM dies and dies for fabricating inlay, crown and bridge wax patterns. A thick mix is prepared as per manufacturer’s instruction and vibrated into a rubber base impression. The base for such a model is poured in dental stone or dental plaster. Die stone should be left for twenty four hours to gain maximum hardness and the cast should be separated one hour after pouring. The abrasion resistance of die stone is not high as other die materials like epoxy resin.

Mined gypsum is ground and heated. When heated, gypsum (calcium sulphate dihydrate) loses part of its water of crystallization and changes to calcium sulphate hemihydrate. On further heating, the remaining water of crystallization is lost. First, hexagonal anhydrite (soluble anhydrite) is formed. Later, orthorhombic anhydrite (insoluble anhydrite) is formed.\\n|110-130 °C|130-200 °C|200-1000 °C|\\n|---|---|---|\\n|CaSO4.2H2O (Calcium sulphate dihydrate)|CaSO4.½H2O (Calcium sulphate hemihydrate)|CaSO4 (Hexagonal anhydrite)|\\n| | |CaSO4 (Orthorhombic anhydrite)|\\nDepending on the method of calcination, there are two forms of hemihydrates.\\n- Beta hemihydrate (plaster)\\n- Alpha hemihydrate (stone)\\n- Alpha modified hemihydrate (die stone)\\nGypsum is ground and heated in an open kettle on kiln at a temperature of 110 to 130 °C.

The amount of water required to produce a workable mix varies between the products. As evident from the above reaction not all of the hemihydrate converts to dihydrate. The amount of conversion is dependent on the type of stone. The highest conversion rate is seen in plaster (90%). In Type 4 and 5 stone the dihydrate content is about 50%.\\nThree theories have been proposed.\\n---\\n# COLLOIDAL THEORY\\nThe theory proposes that when mixed with water, plaster enters into a colloidal state through a sol-gel mechanism. In the sol state, hemihydrate combines with water (hydrates) to form dihydrate. As the water is consumed, the mass turns to a ‘solid gel’.\\n# HYDRATION THEORY\\nThe hydration theory suggests that rehydrated plaster particles join together through hydrogen bonding to the sulfate groups to form the set material.\\n# Dissolution–precipitation theory (crystalline theory)\\nThis theory is more widely accepted. According to the theory, the plaster dissolves and reacts to form gypsum crystals which interlock to form the set solid. The setting reaction is explained on the basis of difference in solubility of hemihydrate and dihydrate. Hemihydrate is four times more soluble than dihydrate.\\n- When hemihydrate is mixed in water, it forms a fluid workable suspension.\\n- Hemihydrate dissolves until it forms a saturated solution.\\n- Some dihydrate is formed due to the reaction. Solubility of dihydrate is much less than hemihydrate, the saturated hemihydrate is supersaturated with respect to the dihydrate. All supersaturated solutions are unstable. So the dihydrate crystals precipitate out.',\n",
       " '- As the dihydrate precipitates out, the solution is no longer saturated with hemihydrate and so it continues to dissolve. The process continues until no further dihydrate precipitates out of the solution.\\nInitially there is little reaction and thus little or no rise in temperature. This time is referred to as the induction period. As the reaction proceeds, gypsum is formed in the form of needle-like clusters, called spherulites. Continued growth and intermeshing of crystals of gypsum leads to thickening and hardening of the mass into a strong solid structure.\\n# The MICROSTRUCTURE OF SET GYPSUM\\nThe set material consists of an entangled aggregate of gypsum crystals having lengths of 5 to 10 μm. Two distinct types of microscopic porosity can be seen in the mass.\\n- Microporosity caused by residual unreacted water. These voids are spherical and occur between clumps of gypsum crystals.\\n|4A and B| |\\n|---|---|\\n|(A) SEM of set gypsum showing needle-like clusters (x1550).|(B) A single crystal is called a spherulite.|\\n---\\n# Box 18.2 Excess water\\nThe actual amount of water necessary to mix the calcium sulphate hemihydrate is greater than the amount required for the chemical reaction (18.61 gm of water per 100 gm of hemihydrate).

       " 'Within limits the longer and faster the plaster is mixed, the faster it will set because nuclei of crystallization are broken and well-distributed within the mass.\\n# Water/Powder Ratio\\nMore the water used for mixing, the fewer the nuclei per unit volume. Thus setting time will be prolonged.\\n# Temperature\\nOn increasing from a room temperature of 20 °C to a body temperature of 37 °C, the rate of the reaction increases slightly and the setting time is shortened. As the temperature is raised above 37 °C the rate of reaction decreases and the setting time is lengthened. At 100 °C the solubilities of hemihydrate and dihydrate are equal, in which case no reaction can occur and the gypsum will not set.\\n# Modifiers (Accelerators and Retarders)\\nModifiers are chemicals added in order to alter some of the properties and make it more acceptable to the dentist. If the chemical added decreases the setting time it is called an accelerator, whereas if it increases the setting time it is called a retarder.\\nAccelerators and retarders not only modify setting time, they also affect other properties like setting expansion and strength.\\n# Accelerators\\n- Finely powdered gypsum (up to 1%) is added by manufacturers to accelerate setting time. Acts by providing additional nuclei of crystallization. One source of gypsum is slurry water.\\n- In low concentrations, salts like sodium or potassium sulphate (2 to 3%) and sodium chloride (up to 2%) are accelerators. They act by making the hemihydrate more soluble.\\n# Retarders\\nRetarders generally act by forming a layer on the hemihydrate to reduce its solubility. It also inhibits the growth of gypsum crystals.\\n- Borax (1–2%) is the most effective retarder. During setting, it forms a coating of calcium borate around the hemihydrate. Thus, the water cannot come in contact with the hemihydrate.\\n---',\n",
       " '- Borax (1–2%) is the most effective retarder. During setting, it forms a coating of calcium borate around the hemihydrate. Thus, the water cannot come in contact with the hemihydrate.\\n---\\nIn higher concentrations, sodium chloride (3.4% to 20%) and sodium sulphate act as retarders. In higher concentrations, the salt precipitates and poisons the nuclei of crystallization.\\nAcetates, borates, citrates, tartrates and salts like ferric sulphate, chromic sulphate, aluminium sulphate, etc., are retarders, which act by nuclei poisoning by reducing the rate of solution of hemihydrate or by inhibiting growth of dihydrate crystals. Some additives react with hemihydrate, e.g., soluble tartrates and citrates precipitate calcium tartrate and citrate, respectively.\\nColloids such as gelatin, glue, agar, coagulated blood, etc. are effective retarders, presumably acting by nuclei poisoning. Contact with the gypsum during setting results in a soft, easily abraded surface. To avoid, the impression should be thoroughly rinsed in cold water to remove blood and saliva before pouring.\\n# Properties\\n- Setting expansion\\n- Strength\\n- Hardness and abrasion resistance\\n- Reproduction of detail\\n# Setting Expansion\\nNormal setting expansion (0.05 to 0.5%): All gypsum products show a linear expansion during setting, due to the outward thrust of the growing crystals during setting. Crystals growing from the nuclei not only intermesh but also intercept each other during growth.\\nImportance of setting expansion: In dentistry, setting expansion may be both desirable and undesirable depending on the use. It is undesirable in impression plaster, dental plaster and stone as it will result in an inaccurate cast or change in the occlusal relation if used for mounting. ISO requirements for setting expansion for the various types are given in Table 18.1.\\n|Type|% Setting Expansion at 2 hrs.|Comp str.

The manufacturers achieve this by addition of KSO4. This, however, reduces the setting time. To counteract this, retarders like borax are also added (borax also reduces setting expansion).\\nWhen a gypsum product is placed under water before the initial set stage, a greater expansion is seen. This is due to hygroscopic expansion. When expansion begins, externally available water is drawn into pores forming in the setting mass and this maintains a continuous aqueous phase in which crystal growth takes place freely. Under dry conditions this additional water is not available and as expansion occurs, the aqueous phase in the mix is reduced to a film over the growing crystals. It is greater in magnitude than normal setting expansion.\\nImportance Used to expand some gypsum bonded investments.\\nThe strength increases rapidly as the material hardens after the initial setting. Minimum strength requirements (ISO) for various gypsum products are presented in Table 18.1.',\n",

Minimum strength requirements (ISO) for various gypsum products are presented in Table 18.1.\\n- The free water content (excess water) - The greater the amount of free water in the set stone, the less the strength.\\n- Wet strength - It is the strength when excess free water (more than is necessary for reaction) is present in the set gypsum. The wet strength (1 hour compressive strength) for model plaster, dental stone, and die stone are 12.5, 31 and 45 MPa respectively.\\n- Dry strength - It is the strength of gypsum when the excess free water is lost due to evaporation. It is two or more times greater than the wet strength.\\n- Excess water may be removed from gypsum cast by low-temperature drying.

The one hour tensile strength of model plaster is approximately 2.3 MPa. When dry, the tensile strength doubles. The tensile strength of dental stone is twice than that of plaster.',\n",
       " 'Significance: Teeth on a cast may fracture while separating from the impression. Since in practice fracture of gypsum typically occurs in tension, tensile strength is a better guide to fracture resistance.\\nTime at which cast can be used: The cast cannot be used as soon as it reaches its final setting (as defined by the Vicat and Gillmore tests). This is because the cast has not reached its full strength. Technically the cast can be used when it has attained at least 80% of its one hour strength. Current products are ready for use in 30 minutes.\\n# Hardness and Abrasion Resistance\\nDies and casts are often used to construct restorations and prostheses. A good surface hardness and abrasion resistance is therefore essential. Hardness of some gypsum products are presented in Table 18.1.\\nHardness is related to the compressive strength. The higher the compressive strength of the hardening mass, the higher the surface hardness. After the final setting occurs, the surface hardness remains practically constant until most of the excess water is dried, after which it increases.\\nThe surface hardness increases at a faster rate than the compressive strength since the surface of the hardened mass reaches a dry state earlier than the inner portion of the mass. Commercial hardening solutions are available to increase the surface hardness of stone. However, surface hardness and abrasion resistance are not always related, for example, epoxy resin is more abrasion resistant than die stone, even though die stone is harder of the two.\\n# Flow\\nThe flow of freshly mixed gypsum depends on the amount of water used (W/P ratio). The greater the amount of water used, the greater would be the flow. However, a correctly proportioned mix has sufficient flow. Vibrating the mix greatly improves the flow. The flow reduces as it approaches its initial set.\\n# Reproduction of Detail\\n|Significance|Impression plaster has to accurately record oral tissues.|\\n|---|---|',\n",

A die is made and the wax pattern constructed on it. Then the entire assembly (die and pattern) is invested in the divestment (normally the wax pattern is removed from the die and invested separately).\\nThe setting expansion of the material is 0.9% and thermal expansion is 0.6% when heated to 677 °C. The advantage of divestment is that the wax pattern does not have to be removed from the die, thus distortion of the pattern can be avoided.\\nIt is possible to make alpha and beta hemihydrate from the byproducts during the manufacture of phosphoric acid.\\nThe synthetic product is usually more expensive than that made from natural gypsum, but when the product is properly made, its properties are equal to or exceed the latter.

Their basic constituents are essentially similar, their exact proportion is different.\\n# Components of Dental Waxes\\nDental waxes contain natural waxes, synthetic waxes and additives (Table 19.1).\\n# Chemical Nature of Waxes\\n- Hydrocarbons, e.g. saturated alkanes\\n- Esters, e.g. myricyl palmitate (bees wax)\\nSome waxes, in addition, contain free alcohol and acids.\\nEster—formed from union of higher fatty acids (e.g. carboxylic acid) with higher aliphatic alcohol with elimination of water.\\n---\\n|Wax components|Natural waxes|Synthetic waxes|Additives|\\n|---|---|---|---|\\n|Minerals|Paraffin Microcrystalline Barnsdall Ozokerite Ceresin Montan|Acrawax C Aerosol, OT Castorwax Flexowax C Epolene N-10 Albacer Aldo 33 Durawax 1032|Fats - Stearic acid - Glyceryl tristearate|\\n|Plants|Carnauba Ouricury Candelilla Japan wax Cocoa butter| | |\\n|Insect|Beeswax| | |\\n|Animal|Spermaceti Lanolin| | |\\n# MINERAL WAXES\\nParaffin and microcrystalline waxes: These are distillation products of petroleum.

       " '# PLANT WAXES\\nCarnauba: Carnauba, also called Brazil wax and palm wax, is a wax of the leaves of the palm Copernicia prunifera, a plant native to and grown only in the northeastern Brazil. In its pure state it usually comes in the form of hard yellow-brown flakes. Melting range is 84–91 °C.\\nOuricury: Ouricury wax is a brown-colored wax obtained from the leaves of a Brazilian Feather Palm Syagrus coronata or Cocos coronata by scraping the leaf surface. It melts between 79–84 °C.\\nBoth Carnauba and Ouricury raise melting range and hardness of paraffin.\\nCandelilla: It is a wax derived from the leaves of the small Candelilla shrub native to northern Mexico and the southwestern United States, Euphorbia cerifera and Euphorbia antisyphilitica. It is yellowish-brown, hard, brittle, aromatic, and opaque to translucent. Melting range is 68 to 75 °C. Mainly hardens paraffin wax.\\n---\\nThese are not true waxes but are chiefly fats. Japan wax is also known as sumac wax, China green tallow, Japan tallow, etc. It is obtained from the lacquer tree and the Japanese wax tree which are native to Japan and China. It is pale yellow, sticky, tough, malleable, has a gummy feel and melts at 51 °C. Cocoa butter is brittle. Japan wax improves tackiness and emulsifying ability of paraffin.\\n|Beeswax (63–73 °C)|Brittle at room temperature, plastic at body temperature.

Mixing of waxes may change their melting range. Melting range varies depending on its use.\\n---\\n# THERMAL EXPANSION\\nWaxes expand when subjected to a rise in temperature and contract as the temperature is decreased.\\nCoefficient of thermal expansion and its importance Dental waxes and their components have the largest CTE among the materials used in restorative dentistry. Temperature changes in wax patterns after removal from the mouth can produce inaccuracies in the finished restoration.\\n# MECHANICAL PROPERTIES\\nThe elastic modulus, proportional limit and compressive strength of waxes are low compared to other dental materials. These properties are strongly dependent on the temperature. As temperature decreases, the properties improve.\\n# FLOW\\n3. The length of time the force is applied.\\nFlow increases as the melting point of the wax is approached.\\n# RESIDUAL STRESS\\nRegardless of the method used to make a wax pattern, residual stresses will exist in the completed pattern. The stress may be compressive or tensile in nature.\\nExample A When a specimen is held under compression during cooling, the atoms and molecules are forced closer together. After the specimen is cooled to room temperature and the load is removed, the motion of the molecules is restricted. This restriction results in residual stress (hidden stresses) in the specimen. When the specimen is heated, release of the residual stress is added to the normal thermal expansion, and the total expansion is greater than normal.',\n",
       " 'Example B When a specimen is cooled while under tension, the release of the residual tensile stress results in a dimensional change that is opposite to thermal expansion, i.e., it can result in overall contraction of the specimen.\\n# DUCTILITY\\nLike flow, the ductility increases as the temperature of the wax is increased. In general, waxes with low melting points have greater ductility than those with high melting points.\\n# PATTERN WAXES\\nMany dental restorations or prostheses are first made with pattern waxes. The wax is later replaced with the permanent material, e.g. cast gold alloys, cobalt-chromium-nickel alloys, or polymethyl methacrylate resin. All pattern waxes have two major qualities which cause serious problems in their use—thermal change in dimension and tendency to warp or distort on standing, e.g. inlay casting wax, RPD casting wax and baseplate wax.\\n---\\n# Types\\n|1.|Casting waxes|\\n|---|---|\\n| |- Inlay|\\n| |- Removable partial denture (the metal frame)|\\n| |- Milling wax|\\n|2.|Baseplate wax (used in the construction of complete and partial denture)|\\n# Inlay Casting Wax\\nThe inlay casting wax is among the oldest waxes in dentistry.\\n# Uses\\nThe pattern for inlays, crowns and FPDs is first made in wax (Figs. 19.1A to D), and then replaced by metal during casting.\\nDirect and indirect techniques If the pattern is made directly in the tooth (in the mouth), it is said to be prepared by direct technique (Class 2 wax). If it is prepared on a replica of the tooth (die), it is called indirect technique (Class 1 wax).\\n# Ideal Requirements of Inlay Casting Waxes\\n1.

It is used to establish the melting point. Different varieties, with different melting points can be produced. Paraffin wax flakes trimmed do not give a smooth surface, so other waxes are added to modify.\\n- Ceresin (10%) - Partially replaces paraffin. Increases toughness. Easy to carve.\\n- Gum damar (1%) - Damar resin (a natural derivative from pine tree) improves the smoothness during molding and makes it more resistant to cracking and flaking. It also increases toughness of the wax and enhances the luster of the surface.',\n",
       " '- Carnauba wax (25%) - This wax is quite hard and has a high melting point. It is combined with paraffin to decrease the flow at mouth temperature. It has an agreeable odor and gives glossiness to the wax surface.\\n- Candelilla wax - This wax can be added to replace carnauba wax. It contributes the same qualities as carnauba wax, but its melting point is lower and is not as hard as carnauba wax.\\n- Synthetic waxes - In modern inlay waxes, carnauba wax is often replaced partly by certain synthetic waxes (Montan). Because of their high melting point, more paraffin can be incorporated and the general working qualities are improved.\\nClass 1 inlay wax is meant for use in the laboratory whereas, Class 2 wax is used in the mouth (indirect technique). Obviously, both would have slightly different properties.\\n* One popular US reference text has described this classification in reverse.

Excess residue can result in an incomplete casting.\\nHold the stick of wax over the visible flame and rotate it rapidly until it becomes plastic taking care not to volatilize the wax. The softened wax is shaped approximately to the form of the prepared cavity. After the wax is inserted into the cavity, it is held under finger pressure while it solidifies. The wax should be allowed to cool gradually to mouth temperature. Cooling rapidly by application of cold water results in differential contraction and development of internal stresses. Localized reheating of wax with warm carving instruments has a similar effect and more distortion may occur. A cold carving instrument should be used for direct wax pattern. Withdraw the wax pattern carefully in the long axis of the preparation. The pattern should be touched as little as possible with the hands to avoid temperature changes.\\nInlay pattern is prepared over a lubricated die.

When the water is mixed, the hemihydrate reacts to form dihydrate which sets to form a solid mass which binds the silica particles together.\\n# SETTING TIME\\nAccording to AdA Sp. No. 2 for inlay investments, setting time should not be less than 5 minutes and not more than 25 minutes. The modern inlay investments set initially in 9 to 18 minutes. This provides sufficient time for mixing and investing the pattern.\\n# PROPERTIES OF GYPSUM INVESTMENTS\\n# THERMAL BEHAVIOR OF GYPSUM\\nWhen gypsum is heated to a high temperature, it shrinks and fractures. At 700 °C, it shows slight expansion and then great amount of contraction. The shrinkage is due to decomposition.\\n---\\nand release of sulfur dioxide. It contaminates the casting with the sulfides of silver and copper.

This occurs at a transition temperature, characteristic of the particular form of silica.',\n",
       " '# THERMAL BEHAVIOR OF SILICA\\nWhen heated, quartz or cristobalite changes its crystalline form. This occurs at a transition temperature, characteristic of the particular form of silica.\\n- Quartz when heated, inverts from a ‘low’ form known as alpha-quartz to a ‘high’ form called as beta-quartz at a temperature of 375 °C.\\n- Cristobalite similarly when heated, inverts from ‘low’ or alpha-cristobalite to ‘high’ or beta-cristobalite at a temperature between 200 °C and 270 °C.\\nThe beta forms are stable only above the transition temperature. It changes back to the low or alpha-form occurs upon cooling in each case. The density changes (decreases) as alpha-form changes to beta-form, with a resulting increase in volume and a rapid increase in linear expansion.\\n# EXPANSION\\n# Normal setting expansion\\nA mixture of silica and dental stone results in a setting expansion which is greater than when the gypsum product is used alone. The silica particles probably interfere with the intermeshing of the crystals as they form. Thus, the thrust of the crystals is outward during growth. AdA Sp. No. 2 for Type-I investment permits a maximum setting expansion in air of 0.5%. Modern investments show setting expansion of 0.4%. It is regulated by retarders and accelerators.\\n# Hygroscopic setting expansion (HSE)\\nWhen gypsum products are allowed to set in contact with water, the amount of expansion exhibited is much greater than the normal setting expansion. The increased amount of expansion is because water helps the outward growth of crystals. This expansion is known as hygroscopic setting expansion. The investment should be immersed in water before initial set is complete. AdA Sp. No. 2 for Type-II investments requires a minimal 1.2% and maximum 2.2% expansion.\\n1. Composition - The finer the particle size of the silica, the greater is the HSE. Alpha-hemihydrate produces a greater expansion than beta-hemihydrate. Higher the silica content, greater is the expansion.',\n",
       " '2. W-P ratio - The higher the W-P ratio of the original investment water mixture, the less is the HSE.\\n3. Temperature - Higher the temperature of the immersion water, less is the surface tension and hence, greater is the expansion.\\n4. Effect of time of immersion - Immersion before the initial set results in greater expansion.\\n---\\n5. Spatulation Shorter the mixing time, the less is the HSE.\\n6. Effect of shelf-life of the investment The older the investment, the less is the hygroscopic expansion.\\n7. Confinement of the investment by the walls of the container or the wax pattern reduces HSE. This effect is much more pronounced on the HSE than on the normal setting expansion.\\n8. Effect of the amount of added water More amount of water added during the setting period, more is the expansion.\\nIn case of gypsum investments, thermal expansion (TE) is achieved by placing the mold in a furnace at a temperature not greater than 700 °C (the investment breaks down if it exceeds this temperature releasing gases which can contaminate the gold alloys). The thermal expansion behavior of one investment is shown in 3.\\nThe amount of thermal expansion required depends on which method is used for casting shrinkage compensation. If hygroscopic expansion technique is used, then TE of 0.5 to 0.6% is sufficient.\\nBut if the compensation is by TE together with normal setting expansion, then the TE should be 1 to 2%.\\nType-l investments should have a TE not less than 1 nor greater than 1.6%.\\n1. TE is related to the amount and type of silica used.\\n2. Effect of the W-P ratio more the water, less the TE.\\n3. Effect of chemical modifiers Small amounts of sodium chloride, potassium chloride and lithium chloride increases TE and eliminates the contraction caused by gypsum.\\nAccording to ISO 15912:2006, the compressive strength for investments should not be less than 2 MPa when tested 2 hours after setting.\\n1. Use of alpha-hemihydrate increases compressive strength (than beta-hemihydrate).',\n",
       " '1. Use of alpha-hemihydrate increases compressive strength (than beta-hemihydrate).\\n2. Use of chemical modifiers increases the strength.\\n3. More water used during mixing, less is the strength.\\n4. Heating the investment to 700 °C may increase or decrease strength as much as 65% depending on the composition. The greatest reduction in strength upon heating is found in investments containing sodium chloride.\\n5. After the investment has cooled to room temperature, its strength decreases considerably because of fine cracks that form during cooling.\\n---\\n# POROSITY\\nThe more the gypsum crystals present in the set investment, the less is its porosity. The less the hemihydrate content and greater the amount of gauging water, the more is its porosity. A mixture of coarse and fine particles exhibits less porosity than an investment composed of a uniform particle size (a certain amount of porosity is essential in the mold in order to allow escape of gases during casting).\\n# FINENESS\\nA fine particle size is preferable to a coarse one. The finer the investment, the smaller will be the surface irregularities on the casting.\\n# STORAGE\\nInvestments should be stored in airtight and moisture-proof containers. Purchase in small quantities.\\n# hYGROSCOPIC ThERMAL INLAY CASTING INVESTMENT\\nInvestment that can be used as a hygroscopic or thermal type is available (e.g. Beauty cast - Whipmix). The investment contains a blend of quartz and cristobalite as the refractory. For the hygroscopic expansion technique, the investment is heated only up to 482 °C. When the thermal casting technique is used the investment (is not immersed in water but) is heated to 649 °C to achieve expansion.\\n# INVESTMENTS FOR CASTING hIGh MELTING ALLOYS',\n",

Casting is the most commonly used method for the fabrication of metal structures (inlays, crowns, partial denture frames, etc.) outside the mouth. A pattern of the structure is first made in wax. This is then surrounded by an investment material. After the investment hardens, the wax is removed (burnt out) leaving a space or mould. Molten alloy is forced into this mould. The resulting structure is an accurate duplication of the original wax pattern. However, casting is not the only way of fabricating restorations and prostheses in dentistry.\\n# METAL RESTORATIONS IN DENTISTRY\\nThere are many ways of fabricating a metallic restoration in dentistry.\\n---\\nSince its discovery, metal casting has played a critical role in the development and advancement of human cultures and civilization. The art of casting metal has been known to man since 4000 BC. Mesopotamia is generally accepted as the birthplace of castings. The first metal to be cast was copper because of its low melting point.\\nThe earliest furnaces were simple and easy to operate, with beeswax used for patterns and bellows for blowing air into the furnace. In the iron age, probably ceramic ovens were used to melt the metals. Crucible and later flame ovens were available for the melting of copper, tin, and lead alloys.\\nDifferent types of molds made from sand, stone, limestone, and sun-baked clay were known from the early times.\\nThe lost form technique was also prevalently used from the early times.

Rapid heating can also cause cracks in the investment due to uneven expansion. It is very important to follow the investment manufacturer’s technique regarding time and temperature for burnout and expansion.\\nThis technique may be used for wax but is particularly indicated if the patterns or sprue formers contain plastic.\\n- The ring is placed in a burnout furnace (5) and heated gradually to 400 °C in 20 minutes.\\n---\\nOver the next 30 minutes, the temperature is raised to 700 °C and maintained for a further 30 minutes.\\n- Place molds directly into preheated oven at 700–850 °C (if higher temperature is warranted, place mold in preheated oven at 370 °C and then raise to final temperature).\\n- Hold for 30–40 minutes and cast.\\nThe casting should be completed as soon as the ring is ready. If casting is delayed the ring cools and the investment contracts. The crown becomes smaller.\\n# CASTING-PROCESS AND EQUIPMENT\\nIt is the process by which molten alloy is forced into the heated investment mold.\\n# CASTING MACHINES\\nCentrifugal machines may be spring driven or motor driven. The main advantage of the centrifugal machines is the simplicity of design and operation, with the opportunity to cast both large and small castings on the same machine.',\n",
       " 'In air pressure type of machine, either compressed air or gases like carbon dioxide or nitrogen, can be used to force the molten metal into the mold. This type of machine is satisfactory for making small castings. This machine does not have vibration and high noise levels owing to the pressure casting and water cooling method. Some systems use argon gas to protect the alloy from oxidation (especially useful for melting titanium).\\nAttached vacuum system Casting machines (both centrifugal and gas pressure type) with attached vacuum system are available. The vacuum creates a negative pressure within the mold, which helps to draw the alloy into the mold.\\n3.

This zone is used for the fusion of the casting alloy.\\nD. Oxidizing zone Outermost zone in which final combustion between the gas and surrounding air occurs. This zone is not used for fusion.\\nThe air and gas mixture is adjusted to get a reducing flame, which is used to melt the alloy (7). A reducing flame is preferred as it does not contaminate the alloy and is the hottest part of the flame.',\n",
       " 'Heating through induction is a common method of melting dental alloys today (Figs. 21.6 and 21.9). Induction heating is the process of heating an electrically conducting object (usually a metal) by electromagnetic induction, where eddy currents are generated within the metal and resistance leads to Joule heating of the metal. An induction heater consists of an electromagnet, through which a high-frequency alternating current (AC) is passed. Induction melting is useful for melting high fusing alloys like metal-ceramic and base metal alloys.\\nAlloys may also be melted by a process known as arc melting. Arc melting is used to melt industrial alloys like steel. Direct current is passed between two electrodes—a tungsten electrode and the alloy. Arc melting produces very high temperatures and is used to melt high fusion metals like titanium (10). Arc melting may be done under vacuum or in an inert atmosphere like argon.\\n# 9 Induction melting. White hot molten alloy in crucible surrounded by the induction coil.\\n---\\n# 10 Titanium casting machine (Dentaurum).\\n# 11 Casting crucible.\\n# 12 Casting flux.\\n# Crucibles\\nThe crucible is a heat resistant container (11) in which the alloy is melted prior to casting. Four types of casting crucibles are available. These are clay, carbon, quartz and ceramic. In dentistry, quartz or ceramic crucibles are commonly preferred as some alloys may be sensitive to carbon contamination. These include palladium-silver and nickel or cobalt based alloys.\\n# Casting',\n",
       " '# Casting\\nThe alloy is melted with the suitable heat source. Flux powder (12) may be sprinkled over the molten metal to reduce the oxides and increase fluidity for casting. When the alloy is molten it has a mirror-like appearance and shifts like a ball of mercury. The hot casting ring is shifted from the burnout furnace to the casting machine. The ring is placed in the casting cradle so that the sprue hole adjoins the crucible. The crucible is solid and placed against the ring to avoid spilling of molten metal. The arm is released and allowed to rotate. This creates a centrifugal force which forces the liquid metal into the mold cavity. The arm is allowed to rotate till it comes to rest. The ring is allowed to cool for 10 minutes till the glow of the metal disappears.\\n# QUENCHING (FOR GOLD ALLOYS)\\nThe ring is then immersed into water. This leaves the cast metal in an annealed (softened) condition and also helps to fragment the investment. Metal-ceramic alloys and base metal alloys are not quenched.\\n# RECOVERY OF CASTING\\nThe investment is removed and the casting recovered. A pneumatic (compressed air driven) chisel may be used to remove the investment.

Chemical contamination of the casting\\nTrapped bubbles on the mold surface or cracks in the investment usually result in nodules or fins on the casting.

Dimension related problems are usually related to improper technique and a failure to understand the properties of the materials involved in fabricating the restoration. Dimensional changes can occur at almost every stage of the restorative process starting with the impression procedure itself. Metal inherently shrinks on cooling and should be compensated for by proper matching of the alloy to the investment and technique.\\n# DISTORTION',\n",

External porosity can cause discoloration of the casting. Severe porosity at the tooth restoration interphase can even cause secondary caries. Internal porosity weakens the restoration.\\n---\\n# Those caused by solidification shrinkage\\n# Those caused by gas\\n# Those caused by air trapped in the mold (back pressure porosity)\\nThese are large irregular voids usually found near the sprue-casting junction (18). It occurs when the cooling sequence is incorrect and the sprue freezes before the rest of the casting. During a correct cooling sequence, the sprue should freeze last. This allows more molten metal to flow into the mold to compensate for the shrinkage of the casting as it solidifies. If the sprue solidifies before the rest of the casting no more molten metal can be supplied from the sprue. The subsequent shrinkage produces voids or pits known as shrink-spot porosity.\\n- Using sprue of correct thickness.\\n- Attach sprue to thickest portion of wax pattern.\\n- Flaring the sprue at the point of attachment or placing a reservoir close to the wax pattern.\\nIt is a variation of the shrink spot porosity. This is an external void usually seen in the inside of a crown opposite the sprue. A hot spot is created by the hot metal impinging on the mold wall near the sprue which causes this region to freeze last. Since the sprue has already solidified, no more molten material is available and the resulting shrinkage causes a type of shrinkage called suck back porosity (Figs. 21.19A to C). It is avoided by reducing the temperature difference between the mold and the molten alloy.\\nLocalized shrink-spot porosity.',\n",

(C) Suck back porosity in a casting.\\n---\\nThese are fine irregular voids within the casting. It is seen when the casting cools too rapidly. Rapid solidification occurs when the mold or casting temperature is too low.\\nMany metals dissolve gases when molten. Upon solidification the dissolved gases are expelled causing tiny voids, e.g. platinum and palladium absorb hydrogen. Copper and silver dissolve oxygen.\\nGas inclusion porosities are also spherical voids but are larger than the pin hole type. They may also be due to dissolved gases, but are more likely due to gases carried in or trapped by the molten metal. A poorly adjusted blow torch can also occlude gases.\\nThis is caused by inadequate venting of the mold. Air is trapped in the mold and is unable to escape. The sprue pattern length should be adjusted so that there is not more than 1/4” thickness of the investment between the bottom of the casting ring and the wax pattern. When the molten metal enters the mold, the air inside is pushed out through the porous investment at the bottom. If the bulk of the investment is too great, the escape of air becomes difficult causing increased pressure in the mold. The gold will then solidify before the mold is completely filled resulting in a porous casting with rounded short margins.\\n- Using adequate casting force.\\n- Use investment of adequate porosity.\\n- Place pattern not more than 6 to 8 mm away from the end of the ring.\\n- Providing vents in large castings.\\nIf there is any wax residue remaining in the mold, it gives off a large volume of gas as the molten alloy enters the mold cavity. This gas can cause deficiencies in the casting and blow holes in the residue button. To help eliminate wax completely from the mold, the burnout should be done with the sprue hole facing downwards for the wax to run down.',\n",

Another reason is the shrinkage of the impression material.\\n# CONTAMINATION\\n- Overheating the alloy\\n- Use of oxidizing zone of flame\\n- Failure to use flux\\n- Not overheating alloy\\n- Use reducing zone of the flame\\n- Use flux\\nBlack casting Can be due to two reasons.\\n1. Overheating the investment above 700 °C causes it to decompose liberating sulfur or sulfur compounds. They readily combine with the metals in gold alloy forming a sulfide film. This gives a dark casting which cannot be cleaned by pickling.\\n2. A black casting can be also due to incomplete elimination of the wax pattern, as a result of heating the mold at too low temperature. A carbonized wax remains which sticks to the surface of the casting. It can be removed by heating over a flame.\\n# OTHER METHODS OF FABRICATING RESTORATIONS AND PROSTHESES\\n7. Three-dimensional printing (additive fabrication).\\n# CAPILLARY CASTING TECHNIQUE (CAPTEK)\\nAdapting and sintering gold alloy foils (Renaissance and Captek) is a novel way of making a metal frame without having to cast it.

Captek P contains platinum, palladium, and gold powder.\\nCaptek P (Platinum/Palladium/Gold) has a porous structure and serves as the internal reinforcing skeleton. On heating in a furnace, the Captek P acts like a metal sponge and draws in (capillary action) the hot liquid gold completely into it. Captek G provides the characteristic gold color of this system.

Electrical discharge machining (EDM), sometimes colloquially also referred to as spark machining, spark eroding, burning, die sinking, wire burning or wire erosion, is a subtractive manufacturing process whereby a desired shape is obtained using electrical discharges (sparks). One of the electrodes is called the tool-electrode or tool, while the other is called the workpiece-electrode, or workpiece. Material is removed from the workpiece by a series of rapidly recurring current discharges between two electrodes, separated by a dielectric liquid and subject to an electric voltage. EDM is useful for difficult to machine alloys such as tungsten and titanium. The advent of computer-aided EDM in the early seventies helped it gain significance in manufacturing processes. In 1982, it was introduced into dentistry by Rubeling to fabricate precision attachments. Since 1990 it has been used widely in implant prostheses.\\n# Applications\\nEDM is used in dentistry for the precise and accurate fabrication of precision attachment removable partial dentures, fixed-removable implant prostheses, and titanium-ceramic crowns. By improving the fit, a passive seating of the restoration on the implant is obtained thereby minimizing stresses to the bone.\\n# Technique\\nThe tool electrode is connected to the implant abutments.

The electrode moves towards and away from the work piece assisted by a hydraulic ram connected to it during the process. The dielectric fluid functions as a conductor and coolant during the procedure. This whole unit has a power source that maintains a direct current. The power level selection is dictated by the alloy properties used, size of object and amount of erosion required. When the cutting gap is sufficiently small, the fluid ionizes allowing electric discharges to occur. These electric discharges occur at regular intervals and such cycles takes place about 250,000 times a second. The sparks gradually erode the inner surface of the restoration in a precise controlled manner thereby achieving a passive and improved fit.\\n# ADVANTAGES\\n- Passive fit of restorations is achieved.\\n- Complex structures can be shaped regardless of metal hardness.\\n- Extremely thin work piece can be machined without distortion as it does not involve mechanical forces.\\n- There is decreased stress on the work piece due to the cooling action of the dielectric fluid.\\n- Smooth finish of final restoration is ensured.\\n- There is decreased oxidation of metals during the procedure (especially useful in titanium to porcelain bonding).\\n- It is rapid, efficient and accurate (within 0.0254 mm).\\n- Frameworks with porcelain can be spark eroded without any stress on the porcelain due to the cooling action of the dielectric fluid.\\n# DISADVANTAGES\\n- Eroding tends to affect the corrosion resistance of titanium.\\n- Skilled personnel and specialized lab equipment is mandatory.\\n- The high cost of the technique limits its usage.\\n# ADDITIVE MANUFACTURING',\n",

The important properties include hardness, strength, ductility, thermal conductivity, etc.\\nIn a cutting tool, e.g. carbide or steel bur (3), the blades or cutting edges are regularly arranged and the removal of material corresponds to this regular arrangement. An abrasive tool on the other hand has many abrasive points that are not arranged in an ordered pattern. Thus, innumerable random scratches are produced. The action of an abrasive is essentially a cutting action. Each tiny particle presents a sharp edge that cuts through the surface similar to a chisel. A shaving is formed which crushes to a fine powder. This powder clogs the abrasive tool and frequent cleaning is required.',\n",
       " 'While abrading metals, the crystalline structure of the metal is disturbed to a depth of 10 μm. The grains become disoriented and strain hardening may occur. Thus, the surface hardness increases. In denture resins too, rigorous abrasion introduces stresses. The generation of heat during abrasion partially relieves such stresses but if it is too great, it may relieve processing stresses and warpage may result. The resin surface may even melt. Similarly, high-speed cutting of tooth structure generates excessive heat which can lead to pulpal damage. Therefore, it is very important to control the heat by air/water spray and intermittent cutting (rather than continuous cutting).\\n1. Size of the abrasive particle.\\n2. The pressure of the abrasive agent.\\n3. Speed at which the abrasive particle moves across the surface being abraded.\\nLarger particles cause deeper scratches in the material and wear away the surface at a faster rate. The use of coarse abrasive is indicated on a surface with many rough spots or large nodules. The scratches caused by the coarse abrasive must then be removed by finer ones.\\nHeavy pressure applied by the abrasive will cause deeper scratches and more rapid removal of material. However, heavy pressure is not advisable as it can fracture or dislodge the abrasive from the grinding wheel, thus reducing the cutting efficiency. In addition, the operator has less control of the abrasion process because the removal of material is not uniform.\\nThe higher the speed, the greater the frequency per unit of time the particles contact the surface. Thus, increasing the speed increases the rate of abrasion. In a clinical situation, it is important to control the speed.\\n---\\n# CLASSIFICATION\\n# FINISHING ABRASIVES\\nFinishing abrasives are hard, coarse abrasives which are used initially to develop contour and remove gross irregularities, e.g. coarse stones.\\n# POLISHING ABRASIVES',\n",

There are various impurities present in it, such as iron oxide, which may also act as an abrasive. The greater the content of alumina, the finer the grade of emery. ALUMINUM OXIDE Pure alumina is manufactured from bauxite, an impure aluminum oxide. It can be produced in fine grain sizes and has partially replaced emery for abrasive purpose. Pure alumina is also used as a polishing agent. Alumina is used in sandblasting machines (Figs. 22.7 and 22.8). GARNET It is composed of different minerals which possess similar physical properties and crystalline form. The mineral comprises of silicates of aluminium, cobalt, magnesium, iron and manganese.

Round smooth particles of sand are poor abrasives. Sand paper with cubical particles present flat faces to the work, and so they are not effective. Irregular and jagged particles are more effective.\\n- Abrasive should be harder than the work it abrades. If it cannot indent the surface to be abraded, it cannot cut it and the abrasive dulls or wears out.\\n- The abrasive should possess a high impact strength. The abrasive particle should fracture rather than dull out, so that a sharp edge is always present. Fracture of an abrasive is also helpful in shedding the debris accumulated from the work. A diamond does not fracture, it loses substances from the tip. They become clogged when used on ductile metals. They are most effective when used on brittle tooth enamel.\\n- They should have attrition resistance, so that it does not wear.\\n# gRADINg Of ABRASIVe AND POLIShINg AgeNTS\\nAbrasives are graded according to the number of the last sieve it passed through. Examples silicon carbide is graded as 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 20, 24, etc. Finer abrasives are designated as powder or flours and are graded in increasing fineness as F, FF, FFF, etc. and impregnated papers as 0,00,000, etc.\\n# BINDeR\\nThe abrasives on a disk and wheel are held together by a binder.\\n- Ceramic bonding is used for silicon carbide or corundum in a mounted abrasive point.\\n- Electroplating with nickel is often used to bind the diamond chips on to the diamond rotary instruments.',\n",

These wear rapidly, but they are useful in some dental operations in which delicate abrasion is required.\\nThe type of binder is related to the life of the tool in use. In most abrasives the binder is impregnated throughout with an abrasive of a certain grade so that, as a particle is removed from the binder during use another takes its place as the binder wears. Furthermore, the abrasive should be so distributed that the surface of the tool wears evenly, particularly if the disk or wheel is used for cutting along its periphery.\\n# DIAMOND BURS\\n---\\n# 4\\nDiamond burs of various grits. The color indicates grit size.\\nBlack - extra coarse, Green—course, Blue—medium, Red—fine, Yellow—extra fine, and White—ultra fine.\\n# 5\\nRubber-bonded abrasives.\\nAttaches the particles to the instrument shank. The larger the grit size the greater the abrasion. Some companies indicate the grit size by color coding (6). Adequate water spray is essential not only to minimize heat but also to reduce clogging.\\n# Polishing\\nIt is the production of a smooth mirror-like surface without much loss of any external form. If the particle size of an abrasive is reduced sufficiently, the scratches become extremely fine and may disappear entirely. The surface then acquires a smooth shiny layer known as a polish. The polishing agents remove material from the surface molecule by molecule. In the process fine scratches and irregularities are filled in by powdered particulates being removed from the surface. The microcrystalline layer is referred to as polish layer or Beilby layer. A polishing agent is employed only after an abrasive obliterates or eliminates most of the fine scratches, leaving a smooth finish.\\n# 6\\nColor coding and corresponding grit size.',\n",
       " '# 6\\nColor coding and corresponding grit size.\\n# Difference Between Abrasion and Polishing\\nThe difference between an abrasive agent and a polishing agent is difficult to define. The terms are generally interchangeable.\\n- Particle size - A given agent having a large particle size acts as an abrasive, producing scratches. The same abrasive with a smaller particle size is a polishing agent.\\n- Material removed - Very little of the surface is removed during polishing—not more than 0.005 mm (0.002 inch).\\n- Speed - The optimum speed for polishing is higher than that for abrading. Linear speed as high as 10000 ft/min may be used. It varies with the polishing agent. Average speed is approximately 7500 ft/min.\\n---\\n# NONABRASIVE POLISHING\\n1. Application of a glaze layer, e.g.\\n- Glazing of composites\\n- Glazing of ceramics\\n# COMPOSITE GLAZING\\nA layer of glaze or gloss (a clear transparent liquid made of unfilled resin) is applied over the restoration and cured. This results in a smooth glossy surface.\\n# GLAZING CERAMICS\\nCeramics are difficult to polish conventionally. The finished restoration is subjected to high temperatures. At this temperature, the surface layer melts and flows to produce a smooth glass-like surface. Alternatively, a glaze layer can be applied and fired to obtain a shiny surface.\\n# ELECTROLYTIC POLISHING\\nElectrolytic polishing is not true abrasion. Although material is removed, it is removed through an electrochemical process rather than an abrasive process. This is the reverse of electroplating. The alloy to be polished is made the anode of an electrolytic cell. As the current is passed, some of the anode is dissolved leaving a bright surface. This is an excellent method for polishing the fitting surface of a cobalt-chromium alloy denture. So little material is removed that the fit of the denture is virtually unaltered.\\n7 Electrolytic polishing unit.\\n# BURNISHING',\n",
       " '7 Electrolytic polishing unit.\\n# BURNISHING\\nIt is related to polishing in that the surface is drawn or moved. Instead of using many tiny particles, only one large point is used. If a round steel point is rubbed over the margins of a gold inlay, the metal is moved so that any gap between the inlay and the tooth can be closed. A special blunt bur revolving at high speed can also be used.\\nNote: The burnishing instrument should not adhere to or dissolve in the surface of the burnished metal, e.g. brass instruments impregnate copper into the surface of a gold inlay.\\n# TECHNICAL CONSIDERATIONS (PROCEDURE)\\n# METHODS OF ABRASION\\n1.

These scratches are removed with finer abrasives but the difference in fineness should not be too great (10B). The use of too fine an abrasive after a relatively coarse abrasive wastes time and may cause streaking.\\n- After changing to a finer abrasive, the direction of abrasion should be changed each time if possible, so that new scratches appear at right angles to the coarser scratches, for uniform abrasion.\\n- When the scratches are no longer visible to the eye, the preliminary polishing can be accomplished with pumice flour applied with a canvas buff wheel [used for resin dentures (11)].\\n- The work is cleaned to remove all traces of abrasives and the particles of the material removed by the abrasive.\\n---',\n",

A polishing cake with grease is held against the buff wheel to impregnate with the agent. The work is held against the wheel and turned, so that all of the surfaces are polished uniformly. A light pressure is used to avoid excess heat generation (especially in resins).\\n# Dentifrices\\nPopularly known as toothpastes these are agents used with a toothbrush to cleanse and polish natural teeth.

       " '|Coloring and flavoring|Mint, menthol, Various fruit flavors|\\n---\\n13 Dentifrices containing herbal and other natural extracts.\\nAlthough in several studies whitening toothpastes have shown the ability to improve tooth color, they have several side effects. The most significant is enamel and dentin abrasion, which in turn leads to increased tooth sensitivity. A key indicator of toothpaste abrasiveness is relative dentin abrasion (RDA) (Box 22.1). The larger the number, the greater the potential of dentin abrasiveness. Dentin abrasion significantly increases when the concentration of abrasive substances in toothpaste is increased. Teeth have a natural defence mechanism against abrasion, called the pellicle*. Its presence on tooth surfaces reduces the abrasive effect of toothpaste on enamel. Therefore, it is best to avoid mechanical tooth cleaning after consuming acidic foods or drinks, as they may dissolve the pellicle and can combine abrasive and erosive defects.\\nBleaching toothpastes contain chemicals, most commonly hydrogen peroxide or calcium peroxide. When peroxides touch the tooth surface, they break down the stain molecule, providing a bleaching effect. Various bleaching systems for home or professional use also contain these substances. When adding peroxides to a toothpaste it should be noted that the concentration is small (usually 1% hydrogen peroxide or 0.5–0.7% calcium peroxide), and the exposure time short. Therefore, there is a lack of evidence about whether such toothpastes can improve the internal tooth color. They certainly bleach the pellicle on the tooth surface.',\n",
       " 'Desensitizing pastes work through two methods—analgesic action and blocking of dentinal tubules. Analgesic toothpastes Toothpastes containing potassium salts maintain a high K+ extracellular level, thus preventing repolarization of the nerve cell membrane and inhibiting the transmission of impulses without causing changes in the pulp. Toothpaste containing 5% or 10% potassium nitrate, can decrease tooth sensitivity for up to 4 weeks.\\n* Dental pellicle is a protein film that forms on the surface enamel by selective binding of glycoproteins from saliva that prevents continuous deposition of salivary calcium phosphate. It forms in seconds after a tooth is cleaned or after chewing. It protects the tooth from the acids produced by oral microorganisms after consuming carbohydrates.\\n---\\nDentin tubule blocking toothpastes Also called tubular occludents. Examples include fluoride compounds (in high concentrations), strontium salts [10% strontium chloride (SrCl)2 and strontium acetate], arginine (with calcium carbonate), hydroxyapatite and calcium sodium phosphosilicate (Novamin). Fluoride compounds increase dentin resistance against acids by forming a protective layer on the tooth surface, increasing the microhardness and precipitating fluoride compounds that block dentin tubules.\\nOral prophylaxis is a widely used procedure in the dental office. Prophylactic polishing agents may be available commercially or can be made in the dental office. They are usually employed in paste form by mixing with a suitable vehicle.\\n- They remove extrinsic stains, pellicle, materia-alba and oral debris.\\n- Impart a polished and esthetic appearance.\\nDifferent types of abrasives may be employed, e.g. zirconium silicate, silica, pumice, etc. In addition, some may contain fluoride in order to reduce caries. They are applied onto the teeth with the help of rubber cups or bristle brushes (14) which are attached to a rotary instrument.',\n",

Dental brazing is covered by ISO 9333.\\n# Terms and Definitions\\nMetal joining operations are usually divided into four categories: welding, brazing, soldering, and cast-joining.\\nWelding: The term welding is used if two pieces of similar metal are joined together without the addition of another metal, i.e., the metal pieces are heated to a high enough temperature so they join together by melting and flowing.\\nBrazing and Soldering: The words soldering and brazing are used if two pieces of metal are joined by means of a third metal called filler.\\n---\\n# Brazing\\nDuring soldering, metal parts are joined together by melting a filler metal between them at a temperature below the solidus temperature of the metal being joined and below 450 °C. In dentistry, the joining of metal parts is done at temperatures above 450 °C, and therefore the operation should ideally be called brazing. This is also the term used by the ISO. However, most dentists still prefer to use the word soldering. The term ‘brazing material’ is often used interchangeably with the term ‘solder’.\\n# Substrate Metal',\n",
       " '# Substrate Metal\\nSubstrate metal or parent metal refers to the metal parts to be joined. In dentistry, alloys that can be soldered or welded include alloys of gold, silver, palladium, nickel, cobalt, titanium, etc.\\n# Ideal Requirements of a Brazing Material (Dental Solder)\\n1. It should melt at temperatures below the solidus temperature of the parent metal.\\n2. When melted, it should wet and flow freely over the parent metal.\\n3. Its color should match that of the metal being joined.\\n4. It should be resistant to tarnish and corrosion.\\n5. It should resist pitting during heating and application.\\n# Types of Solders or Brazing Materials\\n# Soft Solders\\nSoft solders have a low melting range of about 260 °C. They can be applied by simple means like a hot soldering iron. They lack corrosion resistance and so are not suitable for dental use, e.g., lead-tin alloys (plumbers solders).\\n# Hard Solders\\nThese have a higher melting temperature and greater strength and hardness. They are melted with the help of gas blowtorches or occasionally in an electric furnace. Hard solders are more commonly used in dentistry. They are also used for industrial purposes and in the jewelry trade, e.g., gold solders and silver solders.\\n# Presoldering and Postsoldering\\nThe term presoldering (prebrazing) refers to soldering operations performed on metal-ceramic alloys prior to ceramic firing. Postsoldering (postbrazing) refers to soldering performed on the alloy after ceramic firing. Obviously, properties required of the two solders would be different. Solders used in presoldering would be required to permit ceramic bonding as well as withstand the high porcelain firing temperatures.\\n---\\n# APPLICATIONS OF SOLDERING\\n- For soldering various types of wires in orthodontics.\\n- In pedodontics, to construct various types of space maintainers.\\n- In fixed prosthodontics\\n- For joining of various components of fixed partial prostheses (Box 23.1).\\n- Repair of perforations in crowns and bridges.',\n",

(B) Silver solder.\\n# Box 23.1 Improving the fit of a fixed partial denture (FPD) through soldering\\nThe fit of a FDP is often improved when it is cast as two separate pieces. Long span FDPs are especially prone to poor fit because of distortion. The two parts of the prosthesis are tried separately in the mouth. After the operator is satisfied with the individual fit of the castings, the two pieces are assembled in the mouth and their relationship is recorded and transferred with the help of a suitable index material (impression plaster or zinc oxide eugenol or elastomers). The pieces are reassembled in the laboratory and invested using soldering investment. The parts are then joined with solder. If done correctly this technique can give superior fitting fixed partial dentures.\\n---\\n# Component Percent\\n|Silver|10 to 80%|\\n|---|---|\\n|Copper|15 to 50%|\\n|Zinc|4 to 35%|\\n|Cadmium or phosphorous|may be present in small amounts|\\n# Properties of Dental Brazing Materials',\n",

Melting range - Solders with short melting ranges have better flow.\\n2. Composition of parent metal - Gold and silver based alloys have better flow than nickel based alloys.\\n3. Oxides - Presence of an oxide layer on the parent metal reduces the flow.\\n4. Surface tension of solder.\\n# Color\\nThe color of gold solders varies from deep yellow to light yellow to white. In practice, most dental solders are able to produce an inconspicuous joint.\\n# Tarnish and Corrosion Resistance\\nTarnish resistance increases as the gold content increases. However, lower fineness gold alloys also perform well clinically without any serious tendency to discolor. Silver solders have reduced tarnish resistance when compared to gold alloy solders.\\n# Mechanical Properties\\nGold solders have adequate strength and hardness and are comparable to dental cast gold alloys having a similar gold content. Silver solders also have adequate strength and are similar to the gold solders.\\n# Tensile Strength of Brazed Joint\\nAccording to ISO 9333:2006, the tensile strength of the brazed joint should exceed 250 MPa. If the 0.2% proof strength of either one or both of the metallic materials to be joined by the brazing material is below 250 MPa, the tensile strength should exceed the lower of the two.\\n# Microstructure of Soldered Joints',\n",

For a solder to wet and flow properly, the parent metal must be free of oxides. This is accomplished with the help of a flux.\\n# Function of Flux\\n1. To remove any oxide coating on the parent metal.\\n2. To protect the metal surface from oxidation during soldering.\\n# Types\\nFluxes may be divided into three activity types.\\n# Protective\\nThis type covers the metal surface and prevents access to oxygen so no oxide can form.\\n# Reducing\\nThis reduces any oxide present to free metal and oxygen.\\n# Solvent\\nThis type dissolves any oxide present and carries it away. Most fluxes are usually a combination of two or more of the above.\\n# Commonly Used Dental Fluxes\\nBoric and Borate Compounds: Boric acid and borax are used with noble metal alloys. They act as protective and reducing fluxes.\\nFluorides: Fluoride fluxes like potassium fluorides are used on base metal alloys and are usually combined with borates. They help to dissolve the more stable chromium, nickel, and cobalt oxides. Fluoride fluxes should be used carefully around porcelain as it can attack the porcelain. Note excess flux should be avoided as it can get entrapped within the filler metal and result in a weak joint.\\n- Liquid (applied by painting)\\n- Paste\\n2 A fluoride flux for base metal alloys.\\n---\\nPrefluxed solder in tube form.',\n",

The flow can be controlled by use of an antiflux material. Solder will not flow into an area where antiflux has been applied. It is applied before the flux or solder is applied. Examples of antiflux are graphite (soft lead pencil), rouge (iron oxide) or whiting (calcium carbonate) in an alcohol and water suspension.\\nThe most commonly used heat source is a gas-air or gas-oxygen torch. The flame must provide enough heat not only to melt the filler metal but also to compensate for heat loss to the surroundings. Thus, the flame should not only have a high temperature but also a high heat content. Low heat content of fuels lead to longer soldering time and more danger of oxidation. Heat content is measured in Btu per cubic foot of gas.\\n1. Hydrogen - It has the lowest heat content (275 Btu) and therefore heating would be slow. It is not indicated for soldering of large FDPs.\\n2. Natural gas - It has a temperature of 2680 °C and heat content is four times that of hydrogen (1000 Btu). However, normally available gas is nonuniform in composition and frequently contains water vapor.\\n(A) A microflame soldering unit such as this uses hydrolysis to split water into hydrogen and oxygen which is then used as fuel for the flame. (B) Micro flame soldering.\\n---\\nAcetylene It has the highest flame temperature (3140 °C) and a higher heat content than H2 or natural gas. However, it has certain problems. Temperature from one part of its flame to another may vary by more than 100 °C. Therefore, positioning the torch is critical and proper part of the flame should be used. It is chemically unstable and decomposes readily to carbon and hydrogen. The carbon may get incorporated into the Ni and Pd alloys, and hydrogen may be absorbed by the Pd alloys.',\n",
       " 'Propane It is the best choice. It has the highest heat content (2385 Btu) and a good flame temperature (2850 °C).\\nButane It is more readily available in some parts of the world and is similar to propane. Both propane and butane are uniform in quality and water-free.\\nOven Brazing (Furnace Brazing) An electric furnace with heating coils may be used for brazing. The furnace also provides heated surroundings, so less heat is lost to other parts of the fixed partial denture and the atmosphere.\\nFree Hand Soldering In free hand soldering, the parts are assembled and held in contact manually while the heat and solder are applied.\\nInvestment Soldering In investment soldering, the parts to be joined are mounted in a soldering type of investment.

Therefore, an optimum gap is necessary for proper flow, strength of the joint and to avoid distortion of the assembly. Gap width ranging from 0.13 to 0.3 have been suggested.\\n| |If the gap is too narrow|If the gap is too great|\\n|---|---|---|\\n- Flux inclusion\\n- There is a tendency for the parts to draw together as the solder solidifies\\n|\\n# Flame\\nThe flame has multiple zones (5). The portion of the flame that is used should be neutral or slightly reducing. An improperly adjusted or positioned flame can lead to oxidation and/or carbon inclusion. Once the flame has been applied to the joint area, it should not be removed until brazing is complete. Due to its reducing nature, the flame gives protection from oxidation.',\n",
       " 'The temperature used should be the minimum required to complete the brazing operation. Prior to the placement of the solder, the parent metal is heated till it is hot enough to melt the filler metal as soon as it touches. A lower temperature will not allow the filler to wet the parent metal. A higher temperature increases the possibility of diffusion between parent and filler metal.\\nThe flame is held until the filler metal has flowed completely into the connection and a moment longer to allow the flux or oxide to separate from the fluid solder. Insufficient time increases chances of incomplete filling of joint and possibility of flux inclusion in the joint. Excessive time increases the possibility of diffusion. Both conditions cause a weaker joint.\\n# Pitted Solder Joints\\n- Volatilization of the lower melting components due to heating at higher temperatures and for longer time.\\n- Improperly melted or excess flux that is trapped in the solder joint.

On pressing the switch a large current passes through the wires or band between the copper electrodes. The combined heat and pressure fuses the metal pieces at that point and joins them. This kind of welding may also be referred to as ‘spot welding’. Prosthodontic appliances are welded in a larger machine. The parts to be joined are held together in a clamp. A hand or foot controlled switch controls the current. Weld joints are susceptible to corrosion because of precipitation of chromium carbide and consequent loss of passivation.\\nPlasma Arc Welding (PAW) and Tungsten Inert Gas (TIG) welding are techniques in which a union is obtained by heating materials by an arc established between a nonconsumable tungsten electrode and the part to be welded. The electrode and the area to be welded are protected by using an inert gas, usually argon or a mixture of inert gases (argon and helium). The basic equipment consists of a power supply, a torch with a tungsten electrode, a shielding gas source, and an opening system for the arc. The main difference between TIG and plasma welding is the use of a constrictor torch that concentrates the electric arc in plasma welding.',\n",
       " 'The equipment allows for the adjustment of both the pulse and current which is required for welding. After adjusting the machine, screw into one of the claws a structure without use and position the parts to be welded with hands or through specific equipment, which position the parts to be joined. The argon activation is done by a foot pedal. The foot pedal is pressed until the argon flows. The buzzer will indicate when contact is made. Quickly release the pedal. The weld will be made, and the flow of argon will continue for a few seconds. It is possible that in the first few attempts, the electrode will stick to the piece making it necessary to regrind the same.\\n1.

The term “laser” originated as an acronym for “light amplification by stimulated emission of radiation”. The first laser was built in 1960 by Theodore H. Maiman at Hughes Laboratories. Laser is finding increasing applications in dentistry (Box 23.2) including welding. The laser used is a pulsed neodymium laser with a very high power density. Among their many applications, lasers are used in optical disc drives, laser printers, and barcode scanners; fiber-optic and free-space optical communication; laser surgery and skin treatments; laser pointers; cutting and welding materials; military and law enforcement devices for marking targets and measuring range and speed; and laser lighting displays in entertainment.\\nLasers have been used in dentistry since 1994 to treat a number of dental problems. But, despite FDA approval, no laser system has received the American Dental Association’s (ADA) Seal of Acceptance. That seal assures dentists that the product or device meets ADA standards of safety and efficacy, among other things. The ADA, however, states that it is cautiously optimistic about the role of laser technology in the field of dentistry. These lasers are different from the cold lasers used in phototherapy for the relief of headaches, pain, and inflammation.\\n- Tooth decay - Lasers are used to remove decay within a tooth and prepare the surrounding enamel to receive the filling.\\n- Curing - Lasers are also used to “cure” or harden composite fillings.\\n- Gum disease - Lasers are used to reshape gums and eliminate pockets.\\n- Pulpectomy - Remove bacteria during root canal procedures.',\n",

When used for surgical and dental procedures, the laser acts as a cutting instrument or a vaporizer of tissue that it comes in contact with. When used for \"curing\" a filling, the laser takes the role of an intense curing light. When used in teeth whitening procedures, the laser acts as a heat source and enhances the effect of tooth bleaching agents.\\n- Compared to the traditional dental drill, lasers have certain advantages\\n- They cause less pain in some instances, therefore, reducing the need for anesthesia.\\n- They may reduce anxiety in patients uncomfortable with the use of the dental drill.\\n- They minimize bleeding and swelling during soft tissue treatments.\\n- They may preserve more healthy tooth during cavity removal.\\n- Lasers cannot be used on teeth with fillings already in place.',\n",

For example, lasers cannot be used to fill cavities located between teeth, around old fillings, and large cavities that need to be prepared for a crown. In addition, lasers cannot be used to remove defective crowns or silver fillings, or prepare teeth for fixed prostheses.\\n- Traditional drills may still be needed to shape the filling, adjust the bite and polish the filling, even when a laser is used.\\n- Lasers do not fully eliminate the need for anesthesia.\\n- Laser treatment is more expensive since the cost of the laser is much higher than a dental drill. Lasers can cost between 6 to 7 times the cost of a standard drill.\\n|Types of Lasers|Uses|\\n|---|---|\\n|The Erbium YAG laser|Possesses the potential of replacing the drill.

The two parts are joined by a third metal which is cast into the space between the two. The two parts are held together purely by mechanical retention which is achieved by proper flow of the new metal during casting. Therefore, if the cast metal is poorly adapted it can result in a weak joint.\\nThe joint area is ground to make a space of at least 1 mm. Mechanical undercuts are prepared at the interphase. The parts to be joined are assembled with the help of an index. Hard inlay casting wax is flowed into the space and a sprue is attached. The structure is then invested in a casting ring using suitable casting investment. The wax is burnt out and molten metal is cast into the space.\\n12 - A mechanical interlocking design between two parts joined by cast-metal.\\n# RADIOGRAPHIC ASSESSMENT OF JOINTS\\nMost prosthodontic structures are usually fabricated in commercial laboratories. The quality of the structure especially that of the joints can be assessed through a radiograph. The structure is placed on a film and exposed. It is turned 90 degrees and exposed a second time on a new film. The structure is assessed for defects like porosity and cracks especially in the joints. Porosity and other defects in the joints can weaken the restoration causing it to fail in the mouth during function. The best joints are those that are cast as one piece, followed by soldered and cast-joined.\\n---\\n# Chapter 24\\n# Additive Manufacturing in Dentistry\\n# Chapter Outline\\n- Classification of 3D Printing\\n- Digital Light Processing\\n- Fused Deposition Modelling\\n- Applications\\n- Robocasting\\n- Fundamentals of 3D Printing\\n- Classification of Additive Manufacturing (AM) Technologies\\n- Electron Beam Melting (EBM)',\n",

More popularly known as ‘three-dimensional printing’, it is an additive manufacturing process in contrast to conventional CAD/CAM which is a subtractive process. The first 3D printer was invented by Hideo Kodama of Nagoya, Japan. In 1984, Chuck Hull of 3D Systems Corporation further refined the process and named it stereolithography. The process involved the sequential laying down of photocured polymer to produce a three-dimensional plastic object.\\nAs the technology developed it encompassed a wider variety of technologies and materials including metals, waxes, polymers, paper, ceramics, etc. By 2000, the umbrella term additive manufacturing (AM) technologies was used to describe all processes involving the CAD based production of objects through sequential layering.\\nSynonyms: Other terms include three-dimensional printing, desktop manufacturing, rapid manufacturing, additive fabrication, additive layer manufacturing, layer manufacturing, and freeform fabrication, rapid prototyping, etc.\\n# Applications\\n---\\n5.

       " '# Classification of Additive Manufacturing (AM) Technologies\\nThe different types of 3D printers each employ a different technology that processes different materials in different ways. It is important to understand that one of the most basic limitations of 3D printing, in terms of materials and applications is that there is a no ‘one solution fits all’. For example some 3D printers process powdered materials (nylon, plastic, ceramic, metal), which utilize a heat source (laser, electron beam) to sinter/melt/fuse layers of the powder together in the defined shape. Others process liquid resin and again utilize a light/laser to solidify the resin layer by layer. Jetting of fine droplets is another 3D printing process, reminiscent of 2D inkjet printing, but with a binder to fix the layers. Perhaps the most common and easily recognized process is deposition, and this is the process employed by the majority of entry-level 3D printers. This process extrudes plastics, commonly PLA or ABS, in filament form through a heated extruder to form layers and create the predetermined shape. The various types of additive manufacturing technologies currently available are summarized in Table 24.1 and Boxes 24.1 to 24.8.\\n|Type|Technologies|Materials|\\n|---|---|---|\\n|Material extrusion|Fused filament fabrication (FFF) also called fused deposition modelling (FDM)|Thermoplastics (e.g. PLA, ABS, HIPS, nylon), HDPE, metals, edible materials, rubber (Sugru), modelling clay, plasticine, RTV silicone, porcelain, metal clay, etc|\\n| |Robocasting|Ceramics, metal alloy, cermet, metal matrix composite, ceramic matrix composite|\\n|Powder bed fusion|Direct metal laser sintering (DMLS)|Almost any metal alloy|\\n| |Electron beam melting (EBM)|Almost any metal alloy including titanium|\\n| |Selective laser melting (SLM)|Titanium, cobalt chromium, stainless steel|\\n| |Selective laser sintering (SLS)|Thermoplastics, metals, ceramics, glass|\\n| |Selective heat sintering (SHS)|Thermoplastics|',\n",

The popular name for the process is fused deposition modeling (FDM), however this is a trade name, registered by Stratasys, the company that originally developed it. Other manufacturers generally referred to it as Fused Filament Fabrication (FFF).\\nThe process works by melting plastic filament that is deposited, via a heated extruder, a layer at a time, onto a build platform. Each layer hardens as it is deposited and bonds to the previous layer. Systems have evolved and improved to incorporate dual extrusion heads.\\n# box 24.5 Robocasting',\n",
       " '# box 24.5 Robocasting\\nRobocasting or Direct Ink Writing (DIW) is an additive manufacturing technique in which a filament of ‘ink’ is extruded from a nozzle, forming an object layer by layer. The technique was first developed in the United States in 1996 as a method to allow geometrically complex ceramic green bodies to be produced. A fluid (typically a ceramic slurry), referred to as an ‘ink’, is extruded through a small nozzle, drawing out the shape of each layer of the CAD model. The ink exits the nozzle in a liquid-like state but retains its shape immediately, exploiting the rheological property of shear thinning. It is distinct from fused deposition modeling (FDM) as it does not rely on the solidification or drying to retain its shape after extrusion.\\nTo date the most researched application for robocasting is in the production of biologically compatible tissue implants (bioprinting). Lattice structures can be formed quite easily which allow bone and other tissues in the human body to grow and eventually replace the transplant. With various medical scanning techniques the precise shape of the missing tissue is established and input into 3D modeling software and printed.\\n# box 24.6 Electron beam melting (EBM)',\n",
       " '# box 24.6 Electron beam melting (EBM)\\nThe Electron Beam Melting 3D printing technique is a proprietary process developed by Swedish company Arcam. This metal printing method is very similar to the Direct Metal Laser Sintering (DMLS) process in terms of the formation of parts from metal powder. The key difference is the heat source, which, as the name suggests is an electron beam, rather than a laser, which necessitates that the procedure is carried out under vacuum conditions. EBM has the capability of creating fully-dense parts in a variety of metal alloys, even to medical grade, and as a result the technique has been particularly successful for a range of production applications in the medical industry, particularly for implants. However, other hi-tech sectors, such as aerospace and automotive have also looked to EBM technology for manufacturing fulfillment.\\n---\\n# box 24.7 Laser sintering technique\\nLaser sintering and laser melting are interchangeable terms that refer to a laser-based 3D printing process that works with powdered materials. The laser is traced across a powder bed of tightly compacted powdered material. As the laser interacts with the surface of the powdered material it sinters, or fuses, the particles to each other forming a solid. As each layer is completed the powder bed drops incrementally and a roller smooths the powder over the surface of the bed prior to the next pass of the laser for the subsequent layer to be formed and fused with the previous layer.\\nThe build chamber is completely sealed as it is necessary to maintain a precise temperature during the process. Once finished, the excess powder is removed to leave the ‘printed’ parts. One of the key advantages of this process is that the powder bed serves as an in-process support structure for overhangs and undercuts, and therefore complex shapes that could not be manufactured in any other way are possible with this process.',\n",
       " 'However, on the downside, because of the high temperatures required for laser sintering, cooling times can be considerable. Furthermore, porosity has been an issue with this process, and while there have been significant improvements towards fully dense parts, some applications still necessitate infiltration with another material to improve mechanical characteristics.\\n|Scanning mirror|Laser|Roller|\\n|---|---|---|\\n|Building platform| |Powder|\\n| | |Piston|\\n# box 24.8 Sheet lamination and Directed energy deposition\\nSheet lamination processes include ultrasonic additive manufacturing (UAM) and laminated object manufacturing (LOM).

Currently, prosthetic eyes are moulded in acrylic and painted by hand to match the patient’s eye color. This process is time-consuming and expensive, whereas producing the eyes using a 3D printer (9) enables up to 150 eyes to be made in an hour. All of the components are printed from powder in full color using a Z-Corp 510 machine before the resulting form is encased in resin. Compared to the existing handmade production method, this helps to remove any variation in quality and significantly reduces the cost of each eye.

In January 2015, doctors at London’s St Thomas’ Hospital had used images obtained from a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan to create a 3D printing replica of the heart of a two-year-old girl with a complex hole in it. They were then able to tailor a Gore-Tex patch to effect a cure. 3D printing means surgeons can go into an operation with a much better idea of what they would find. Similarly plastic and maxillofacial surgeons in Bengaluru, Karnataka, India, used a 3D printed model (10) for a surgical procedure to plan and correct orbital hypertelorism using both a box osteotomy as well as a facial bipartition technique with the aid of Osteo 3D, a company that is focused on 3D printing for the healthcare industry.

They could be used in drug research and perhaps eliminate the need for testing in animals. The possibility of using 3D tissue printing to create soft tissue architectures for reconstructive and plastic surgery is also being explored. Though scientists have been able to engineer artificial organs such as livers and kidneys, these organs lack crucial elements required for full and independent functioning, such as working blood vessels, tubules for collecting urine, etc. Without these the body has no way to get the essential nutrients and oxygen deep within the tissues. Fully functional printed organs may yet be possibility in the future.',\n",
       " 'In the bioprinting process, layers of living cells are deposited on to a gel medium or sugar matrix and slowly built up to form three-dimensional structures or scaffolds including vascular systems (Box 24.9). Another process uses an extracellular matrix (ECM) protein as scaffold. As Organovo have demonstrated, it is not necessary to print all of the details of an organ with a bioprinter, as once the relevant cells are placed in roughly the right place nature completes the job. This point is illustrated by the fact that the cells contained in a bioink spheroid are capable of rearranging themselves after printing. For example, experimental blood vessels bioprinted using bioink spheroids comprising of an aggregate mix of endothelial, smooth muscle and fibroblast cells, once placed in position by the bioprint head demonstrated migration and reorganization. With no technological intervention, the endothelial cells migrate to the inside of the bioprinted blood vessel, the smooth muscle cells move to the middle, and the fibroblasts migrate to the outside.\\nScientists hope to be able one day to print some types of replacement parts directly into patients’ bodies.

It mimics the natural extracellular matrix and is biodegradable. This material was developed by researchers at the University of Missouri, Columbia.\\n2. To make bioink, scientists create a slurry of cells that can be loaded into a cartridge and inserted into a specially designed printer, along with another cartridge containing a gel known as biopaper. After inputting the standards for the tissue, the printer lays down alternate layers to build a three-dimensional structure, with the biopaper creating a supportive matrix that the ink can thrive on. The individual droplets fuse together, eventually latticing upwards through the biopaper to create a solid structure.\\nOne potential use for bioink is in skin grafting. By creating grafts derived from the patient’s own cells, it could reduce the risk of rejection and scarring. Although initial bioink developments began with skin regeneration, the technology has advanced to also incorporate bone and muscle. This makes bioinks a total regenerative technology. Bioink could also be used to make replacements for vascular material removed during surgeries, allowing people to receive new veins and arteries. Eventually, entire organs could be constructed from this material. Bioprinted tissue could potentially remove the anxiety of finding donors as well as also allay fears about contaminated organ supplies or unscrupulous organ acquisition methods. These will enable medical researchers to test drugs on bioprinted models of the liver and other organs, thereby reducing the need for animal tests.',\n",

Metals are among the strongest materials and provide strength and durability to any structure. There are two ways of constructing a metal restoration—direct and indirect. Direct techniques have been used in modern dentistry since the introduction of direct filling gold and amalgam in the 19th century. Indirect dental restorations were introduced into the dental profession with the patenting of the centrifugal casting machine and the lost wax technique by William H. Taggart in 1907.\\n# TERMINOLOGY\\nAn alloy is defined as a metal containing two or more elements, at least one of which is metal and all of which are mutually soluble in the molten state.\\n---\\n# Noble Metals',\n",

Gold, platinum, palladium, rhodium, ruthenium, iridium, osmium, and silver are the eight noble metals. However, in the oral cavity, silver can tarnish and therefore is not considered a noble metal.\\n# Precious Metals\\nThe term precious indicates the intrinsic value of the metal. The eight noble metals are also precious metals and are defined so by major metallurgical societies and federal government agencies, e.g. National Institute of Standards and Technology and National Material Advisory Board. All noble metals are precious but all precious metals are not noble. Of the eight noble metals, four are very important in dental casting alloys, i.e. gold, platinum, palladium and silver. All four have a face-centered cubic crystal structure and all are white colored except for gold.\\n|Metal|Density (g/cm3)|Melting Point (°C)|CTE (× 10-6/°C)|\\n|---|---|---|---|\\n|Gold|19.3|1063|-|\\n|Silver|10.4|961|15.7|\\n|Palladium|12.02|1552|11.1|\\n|Platinum|21.65|1769|-|\\n# Semiprecious Metals\\nThere is no accepted composition which differentiates ‘precious’ from ‘semiprecious’. Therefore, the term semiprecious should be avoided.\\n# Base Metals\\nThese are non-noble metals. They are important components of dental casting alloys because of their influence on physical properties, control of the amount and type of oxidation and their strengthening effect. Such metals are reactive with their environment and are referred to as ‘base metals’. Some of the base metals can be used to protect an alloy from corrosion by a property known as passivation. Although they are frequently referred to as nonprecious, the preferred term is base metal.\\nExamples: Chromium, cobalt, nickel, iron, copper, manganese, etc.',\n",
       " 'Examples: Chromium, cobalt, nickel, iron, copper, manganese, etc.\\n# History and Classification of Dental Casting Alloys\\nAt the beginning of the twentieth century when dental casting techniques were evolving, the alloys were predominantly gold based. Taggart in 1907 was the first to describe the lost wax technique in dentistry. The existing jewelry alloys were quickly adopted for dental purposes. Initially, copper, silver and platinum were the main alloying elements. As the alloys evolved it was felt that a classification was needed. In 1932, the National Bureau of Standards classified the alloys according to their hardness (Type I, Type II, etc.).\\n---\\n1. They should not tarnish in the mouth.\\n2.

       " '---\\n1. They should not tarnish in the mouth.\\n2. They should be strong (for use as bridges).\\nThis soon changed with the introduction of special alloys (metal-ceramic alloys) that could bond to porcelain in the late 1950s. The composition and requirements of these alloys became more complex. For example, they had to contain elements that could enhance bond to porcelain, they had to have a higher melting temperature (because porcelain had high fusion temperatures), etc. Another important development were the rapid increase in gold prices in the 1970s. As gold became more expensive, people began to look for less expensive metals for dental castings. Manufacturers began experimenting with base metal alloys like nickel-chromium and cobalt-chromium. These alloys were already in use since the 1930s for the construction of cast partial denture frameworks. Prior to this, the Type IV gold alloys were used extensively for this purpose. These base metals soon replaced the Type IV gold alloys for partial denture use because of their light weight, lower cost and tarnish resistance. When the gold prices shot up, these base metal partial denture alloys were quickly adapted for use in fixed prosthodontics. Subsequently, newer formulations allowed their use as metal-ceramic alloys. Today there is such a wide variety of alloys in the market that classifying them is not easy. A number of different classifications are mentioned below.\\n# ACCORDING TO USE\\n|A.|Alloys for all metal and resin veneer restorations* (e.g. inlays, posts, resin and composite veneered crowns and FDPs).|\\n|---|---|\\n|B.|Alloys for metal-ceramics restorations (e.g. PFM crowns and FDPs).|\\n|C.|Alloys for removable dentures ** (e.g. RPD frames and complete denture bases).|\\n# BASED ON YIELD STRENGTH AND PERCENT ELONGATION (ADA SP. 5 )\\n|Type I|Soft|\\n|---|---|\\n|Type II|Medium|\\n|Type III|Hard|\\n|Type IV|Extra-hard|',\n",

Since 1989, it was relaxed to include any dental alloy as long as they met the new yield strength and percentage elongation criteria. Types I and II are known as ‘inlay alloys’ and Types III and IV are known as ‘crown and bridge alloys’. Type IV is occasionally used for RPD frames).\\n*Some authors classify this as crown and bridge alloys. Unfortunately, this can create confusion; for example, metal-ceramic alloys are also crown and bridge alloys. **Also known as RPD alloys, which again unfortunately is not fully accurate as they can be used for other structures. However, until a more suitable terminology is found, this classification will be continued.\\n---\\nD. Base metal This classification is popular among manufacturers.\\nBASED ON MECHANICAL PROPERTIES (ISO 22674:2006) The current ISO classification supersedes all previous classifications and covers all metals used in dentistry for restorations and prostheses. It makes no distinction between noble and base metal. ISO 22674:2006 classifies all metallic materials into six types according to its mechanical properties.\\n|Type|Description|\\n|---|---|\\n|Type 0|Intended for low stress bearing single-tooth fixed restorations, e.g. small veneered one-surface inlays, veneered crowns.*|\\n|Type 1|Intended for low stress bearing single-tooth fixed restorations, e.g. veneered or unveneered one-surface inlays, veneered crowns.|\\n|Type 2|Intended for single tooth fixed restorations, e.g. crowns or inlays without restriction on the number of surfaces.|\\n|Type 3|Intended for multiple unit fixed restorations, e.g. bridges.|',\n",

They are similar in some aspects, but yet, each have their own distinct features. These alloys vary not only in the type of metal but also the percentage of each within the alloy. In spite of their wide variation in composition, they must meet the requirements of their intended use. For example, all metal-ceramic alloys regardless of whether they are noble or base must meet the requirements of porcelain bonding. For this reason, the classification according to use is recommended and will be the basis of the subsequent discussion of alloys.\\n- High noble\\n- Noble\\n- Predominantly base metal\\n- Base metal\\n- High noble\\n- Noble\\n- Predominantly base metal\\n- Base metal\\n- High noble\\n- Noble\\n- Predominantly base metal\\n- Base metal\\n# GENERAL REQUIREMENTS OF CASTING ALLOYS\\nAll cast metals in dentistry have some basic common requirements.\\n1.

They must have minimal shrinkage on cooling after casting.\\n7. They must be easy to solder.\\nNot all of them meet all the requirements. Some have shown a potential for allergic reactions (nickel-containing alloys) and other side effects when used without proper precautions. Some are quite difficult to cast. Some are so hard (base metal alloys) that they are difficult to cut, grind, and polish. All alloys shrink on cooling. Some (base metal alloys) show more shrinkage than others. The shrinkage cannot be eliminated, but it can be compensated for (see investments). Besides these general requirements, alloys intended for a certain specific use must meet requirements for that. For example, metal-ceramic alloys must have additional requirements in order to be compatible with porcelain. The requirements for metal-ceramic alloys will be described later.\\n---\\nThese alloys were among the earliest alloys available to dentistry. The early alloys were mostly gold alloys. Since they were intended for all-metallic and later for resin veneered restorations, they just had to meet the basic requirements (see general requirements). No special requirements are needed for veneering with resin.\\n- Increased esthetic awareness has reduced the trend for metal display.\\n- Increasing popularity of all-ceramic and metal-ceramic restorations.\\n- Reducing popularity of resin and composite as veneering material. Resin facings have a number of disadvantages:\\n- They wear rapidly (poor wear resistance).\\n- They may change color (color instability and stain absorption).\\n- They are porous. They tend to absorb food material and bacteria. This makes it unhygienic and gives it a bad odor.\\n# CLASSIFICATION (ANSI/ADA SP. NO. 5)',\n",

It is alloyed commonly with copper, silver, platinum, nickel and zinc. Alloying gold with these metals not only improves its physical and mechanical properties but also reduces its cost.\\nThe display of metal particularly gold was once acceptable and probably was even a symbol of social status. The current trend is to avoid the display of metal. At the same time, increase in the platinum, palladium and silver content of modern alloys have resulted in whiter colored gold alloys. Thus, there are ‘yellow gold alloys’ and ‘white gold alloys’. The rise in gold prices have also led to the availability of alloys with low gold content. These are the ‘low golds’.\\nThe gold alloys discussed here are high noble alloys because of their high noble metal content (see classification according to nobility).\\n# GOLD CONTENT\\n---\\nIt refers to the parts of pure gold present in 24 parts of alloy, e.g.\\n24 karat gold is pure gold.\\n22 karat gold is 22 parts pure gold and 2 parts of other metal.\\nNote In current dental alloys, the term karat is rarely used.\\nFineness of a gold alloy is the parts per thousand of pure gold. Pure gold is 1000 fine. Thus, if 3/4 of the gold alloy is pure gold, it is said to be 750 fine.\\nNote The term fineness also is rarely used to describe gold content in current alloys (however, it is often used to describe gold alloy solders).\\nThe percentage composition of gold alloys is preferred over karat and fineness. Since 1977, ADA requires manufacturers to specify the percentage composition of gold, palladium and platinum on all their dental alloy packaging.\\nFineness is 10 times the percentage gold composition, i.e. fineness × 10 = %gold.',\n",

Smaller the grain size of the metal, the more ductile and stronger it is. It also produces a more homogeneous casting and improves the tarnish resistance. A large grain size reduces the strength and increases the brittleness of the metal. Factors controlling the grain size are the rate of cooling, shape of the mold and composition of the alloy.\\n# PROPERTIES OF GOLD ALLOYS\\nCOLOR: Traditionally, the gold alloys were gold colored. The color of modern gold alloys can vary from gold to white.

During this period, the intermediate phases are changed to an ordered solid solution (the proper time and temperature for age hardening an alloy is specified by its manufacturer). Ideally, before age hardening an alloy, it should first be subjected to a softening heat treatment in order to relieve all strain hardening (stresses which occurs during finishing).

However, they have lower ductility and corrosion resistance. They also have a significantly lower density than gold alloy. This may affect its castability. A major difference between Types III and IV Ag-Pd alloys is that the latter can be significantly age hardened because of its gold and copper content.\\n---\\nThese are known as base metal alloys and are extensively used in many of the developing countries. In India, because of their relatively low cost many of the laboratories use these alloys along with resin facings. These metals are very strong and hard. Because of this, they are generally difficult to work with (cutting, grinding, polishing, etc.). They are dealt in more detail in subsequent sections.\\n# TITANIUM AND TITANIUM ALLOYS\\nThese metals can be used for all-metal and metal-ceramic restorations, as well as partial dentures.

A layer of porcelain is fused to the alloy to give it a natural tooth-like appearance. Porcelain being a brittle material fractures easily, so these alloys are used to reinforce the porcelain. Several types of alloys are used to cast substructures for porcelain-fused-to-metal crowns and FDPs. They may be noble metal alloys or base metal alloys (see classification). All have coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) values which match that of porcelain.\\nNote CTE has a reciprocal relationship with melting point, i.e. the higher the melting point of a metal, lower is its CTE.\\n---\\n# Porcelain-fused-to-metal (PFM), ceramometal alloys, porcelain-bonded-to-metal (PBM). The preferred term, however, is metal ceramic or PFM.\\n# EVOLUTION OF METAL-CERAMIC ALLOYS\\nThe metal-ceramic alloys evolved from resin-veneered crown and bridge alloys. Resin facing faced the problem of gradual wear and had to be replaced over time. Besides resin could not be used on the occlusal surface. To retain a resin veneered restoration undercuts had to be provided. The early metal-ceramic alloys were high gold alloys (88% gold). They were not strong enough for FDP use. In the early days before porcelain-metal bonding was clearly understood, porcelain had to be retained by mechanical means with the help of undercuts. Later, it was discovered that adding 1% of base metals like iron, tin, indium, etc. induced chemical bonding by the formation of an oxide layer. This significantly improved the bond strength between porcelain and metal.\\n# REQUIREMENTS OF ALLOYS FOR PORCELAIN BONDING\\nIn addition to the general requirements of alloys mentioned earlier, metal-ceramic alloys have certain specific requirements in order to be compatible with porcelain veneering.',\n",
       " 'In addition to the general requirements of alloys mentioned earlier, metal-ceramic alloys have certain specific requirements in order to be compatible with porcelain veneering.\\n1.

However, in spite of the cost, these alloys are user friendly and are preferred in practices where the clientele can afford the cost.\\n- Color: The color can range from white to gold depending on the gold content. The whitening alloys are palladium and platinum. The gold color when present can enhance the vitality of the porcelain thus improving the esthetics.',\n",
       " '- Melting range: Porcelain is fired at a temperature of 900–960 °C. Thus obviously these alloys must have melting temperatures much higher than the temperatures at which porcelain is fired. Pure gold has a melting temperature of 1063 °C. The melting temperature is raised by the addition of platinum (1769 °C) and palladium (1552 °C). The melting temperatures of these alloys range from 1149–1304 °C.\\n- Density: Ranges from 13.5 to 18.3 g/cm³ (depending on the gold content). Because of the high gold and noble metal content, these alloys have a high density. The density reduces as more palladium is added.\\n- Castability: The high density of these alloys make them easy to cast. If done well one can expect most of the fine features to be accurately duplicated.\\n- Yield strength: Ranges from 450 to 572 MPa.\\n- Hardness and workability: Ranges from 182 to 220 VHN. These alloys are relatively softer when compared to the base metal alloys and so are extremely easy to work with. They are easy to cut, grind and polish.\\n---\\nThe higher the value, the more ductile it is. Porcelain bonding The presence of an oxide layer on the surface of metal ceramic alloys assists in chemical bonding of porcelain to the alloy. Pure noble metal alloys rarely form an oxide layer. To induce the formation of an oxide layer, 1% of base metals like tin, indium, iron, etc. are added to the alloy. This significantly improved the bond strength between the porcelain and the metal.\\nSag resistance During porcelain firing, the metal frame has to withstand temperatures as high as 950 °C. At these temperatures, there is a danger of the metal substructure sagging under its weight, thereby deforming. The longer the span, the greater the risk. The ability of a metal to resist sag is known as sag resistance. Compared to base metal alloys, gold alloys are less sag resistant.',\n",
       " 'Tarnish and corrosion Because of their high noble metal content, these alloys are extremely stable in the oral environment. Noble metals have low reactivity to oxygen and therefore do not tarnish easily.\\nBiocompatibility High noble alloys have had a good and safe track record. They are not known to cause any problems in the mouth.\\nReusability These alloys are stable and so scrap from these alloys can be recast at least two or three times. However, the more volatile base metals like zinc, indium, tin, etc., may be lost. To compensate for this, equal amounts of new alloys should be mixed. The scrap should be cleaned by sandblasting and ultrasonic cleaning before use. Alloys from different manufacturers should not be mixed as it may change its composition and properties.\\nScrap value The high noble alloys have good scrap value.

Currently, the noble metal-ceramic alloys are mostly palladium-based. The high cost of gold prompted the development of the cheaper base metal alloys. Unfortunately, many soon became disillusioned because of the difficulty to work with these alloys (poor castability and high hardness). The palladium based alloys were developed during this period. Their properties were between that of the high noble alloys and the base metal alloys.

As mentioned earlier, these alloys were introduced as a cheaper alternative to the more expensive noble metal-ceramic alloys. In countries like the USA, Western Europe and the oil rich Middle-Eastern states, there is a preference for noble and high noble metal-ceramic alloys. In contrast, developing countries have shown a preference for base metal-ceramic alloys. This is because the economic concerns far outweigh the advantages of the more user-friendly high noble alloys.\\nThe first base metal alloys were the cobalt-chromium alloys primarily used for removable partial denture alloys. The nickel-chrome alloys were introduced later. The latest in the series are titanium and its alloys.\\nLike the gold alloys, the base metal alloys can be used for many purposes. However, one must differentiate between the ones used for all-metal and the metal-ceramic restorations. Obviously, the metal-ceramic alloys would be formulated with specific properties since they are to be used with ceramics.\\n---\\nCommercial names Trade names of some metal-ceramic alloys are presented in Table 25.2.',\n",

This is due to the property known as passivation. Passivation is the property by which a resistant oxide layer forms on the surface of chrome containing alloys. This oxide layer protects the alloy from further oxidation and corrosion. These alloys can maintain their polish for years. Other self-passivating alloys are titanium and aluminum.\\nSoldering is necessary to join bridge parts. Long span bridges are often cast in two parts to improve the fit and accuracy. The parts are assembled correctly in the mouth and an index made. The parts are then reassembled in the laboratory and joined together using solder. Base metal alloys are much more difficult to solder than gold alloys.\\nThese alloys have a higher casting shrinkage than the gold alloys. Greater mould expansion is needed to compensate for this. Inadequate compensation for casting shrinkage can lead to a poorly fitting casting.\\nEtching is necessary for resin-bonded restorations (e.g. Maryland bridges) to improve the retention of the cement to the restoration. Etching of base metal alloys is done in an electrolytic etching bath.\\nNickel may produce allergic reactions in some individuals. It is also a potential carcinogen. Beryllium, which is present in many base metal alloys, is a potentially toxic substance. Inhalation of beryllium-containing dust or fumes is the main route of exposure. It causes a condition known as ‘berylliosis’. It is characterized by flu-like symptoms and granulomas of the lungs.',\n",

However, in the case of gold-based metal-ceramic alloys, carbon-containing phosphate-bonded investments are preferred.\\nTitanium in the form of the oxide rutile is abundant in the earth’s crust. The ore can be refined to metallic titanium using a method called the Kroll’s process. Titanium and its alloys have been available to the dental profession since the 1970s. Historically, titanium has been used extensively in aerospace, aeronautical, and marine applications because of its high strength and rigidity, its low density and corresponding low weight, its ability to withstand high temperatures, and its resistance to corrosion. The use of titanium for medical and dental applications has increased dramatically in recent years. Over the past three decades, the development of new processing methods like computer-aided machining and electric discharge machining has expanded titanium’s useful range of applications in biomedical devices. Titanium has become available for use in metal-ceramics. It is also used for removable partial denture alloy frames and of course commercial implants.

Thus it became necessary to develop lighter and more economical alloys. Most of the large castings today are made from base metal alloys, occasionally Type IV gold alloys are used.\\nBesides all the earlier mentioned general requirements of casting alloys, RPD alloys have a few special requirements.\\n1. They should be light in weight. Being much larger structures, the lighter weight aids in retention in the mouth.\\n2. They should have high stiffness. This aids in making the casting more thinner. This is important especially in the palate region, where having a thin palatal portion makes it more comfortable to the patient. The high stiffness prevents the frame from bending under occlusal forces.\\n3. They should have good fatigue resistance. This property is important for clasps.

Though many materials have been tried, currently, the vast majority of implant systems use titanium in some form.\\n# Definition\\nA dental implant is a material or device placed in and/or on oral tissues to support an oral prosthesis (GPT-8).\\nMan has been searching for ways to replace missing teeth for thousands of years. Ancient Egyptians used tooth-shaped shells and ivory to replace teeth. The Etruscans living in what is now modern Italy, replaced missing teeth with artificial teeth carved from the bones of oxen. Further evidence of tooth replacement was found in 1931 by an archaeological team excavating in Honduras. A mandible of Mayan origin was discovered that had tooth-shaped pieces of shells placed in the sockets of three missing lower incisor teeth. Modern implant dentistry began in the early 19th century. A lot of experiments were conducted on what material would work best. Attempts were first made.\\n---',\n",
       " '---\\nat implanting natural teeth from another person’s mouth, but these implants failed due to infection or were rejected by the host tissue. Implants made of gold, porcelain, silver and even lead were being tried, with only a fair measure of success and little or no predictability. As early as 1918, Greenfield devised the Iridoplatinum root form basket implant. Other early implants were those of Chercheve, Formiggini and others. An interesting design was the Tripodal pin implant of Scialom. Interestingly some of these early designs were ahead of their times. Their failure to gain widespread popularity could probably be attributed to the fact that prosthetic techniques, antibiotic use, infection control, instrumentation and impression materials had not yet advanced far enough.\\nOne of the early pioneers in this field Dr. AE Strock in 1931, suggested using Vitallium, a metal alloy for dental implants. In 1947, Manlio Formiggini of Italy developed an implant made of tantalum. At the same time, Raphael Chercheve was using implants made of a chrome-cobalt alloy. By 1964, commercially pure titanium was accepted as the material of choice for dental implants. Ever since almost all dental implants are made of titanium. The body does not recognize titanium as a foreign material, resulting in less host rejection of the implant. Other areas of medicine recognize this fact and use titanium for other implants such as joint replacements and heart valves.',\n",
       " 'In the 1950s an important discovery was made which had great implications for tooth replacement therapy. During an experiment involving the study of blood circulation in animals, Dr. Per-Ingvar Branemark discovered that the hollow titanium rod used in the study was not retrievable when the experiment was complete. Further studies showed that the animals’ bone had directly attached to the titanium surface. This phenomenon was called osseointegration, defined by the American Academy of Implant Dentistry as “the firm, direct and lasting biological attachment of a metallic implant to vital bone with no intervening connective tissue.” This firm anchor is what makes dental implants a wonderful option for replacing teeth.\\nExperimentation with implant designs, not just those that were shaped like the tooth root, was also being done. In 1941, Dr. Gustav Dahl of Sweden provided a retentive mechanism for jaws that were completely edentulous. This was the introduction of the subperiosteal implant. Dr. Leonard Linkow of New York introduced the blade form implant (1) in 1967. These blades came in a variety of sizes and forms and were the most widely used type of implant until the 1980s.\\n# TYPES OF IMPLANTS\\n|A.

Its alloyed form contains 6 wt.% aluminum and 4 wt.% vanadium.\\n# 5\\nFour titanium screw implants in the maxillary edentulous jaw are used to support a screw retained fixed prosthesis.\\n---\\nThe newer implant designs use titanium that is coated with a material that bonds and promotes bone growth (bioactive). The implant is coated with a thin layer of tricalcium phosphate or hydroxyapatite that has been plasma sprayed.\\nThese may be bioactive on bioinert. Their applications are still limited because of their low tensile strength and ductility. Currently they are primarily used as surface coats on titanium implants.\\nBioinert, e.g., aluminum oxide is used either in the polycrystalline form or as a single crystal (sapphire). It is well-tolerated by bone but does not promote bone formation. They are available in screw or blade form and are used as abutments in partially edentulous mouths.\\n18-8 or Austenitic steel had been tried as an implant material. It has high strength and ductility. Currently these materials are rarely used.\\nSince it contains nickel, it should be avoided in nickel sensitive patients. It is most susceptible to pit and crevice corrosion so the passivating layer must be preserved. Direct contact of the implant with a dissimilar metal crown is avoided to prevent galvanism.',\n",
       " 'Polymers have been fabricated in porous and solid forms for tissue attachment and replacement augmentation. However, in some implants they are mainly used within the implants as connectors for stress distribution (shock absorption).\\nIn the past, gold, palladium, tantalum, platinum and alloys of these metals have been used. More recently, zirconium and tungsten have been tried. Titanium has replaced most of these materials. Carbon compounds were used for root replacement in the 1970s. They are also marketed as coatings for metallic and ceramic devices.\\nSince endosseous cylindrical root form implants are the most widely used design, subsequent discussions will focus on these. Implants can range from complex, having multiple components to more simple designs. Most endosseous implants can be divided into two basic parts (6).\\n---\\n# The implant may be\\n|One piece–Implant and abutment are joined together (7A)|Implant fixture|\\n|---|---|\\n|Two-piece–Implant and abutment are separate.

Currently, the most favored form is the cylindrical screw or the tapered screw (Figs. 26.8A to D). The implant is inserted through a surgical procedure. The abutment is usually screwed onto the implant at a later date. The crown is then constructed and either screwed on or cemented onto the abutment thus completing the restoration.\\nImplants are usually designed as a system and depending on the company various accessory components are also available. The components are usually specific for the particular system and are usually not interchangeable. Some of them become part of the implant itself while others aid in the various stages of implant placement and tooth restoration. These include the drills, healing caps, impression copings, implant analogue, laboratory accessories, etc.\\n# IMPLANT ABUTMENTS',\n",

It helps to establish direction of the subsequent drilling and implant placement. Subsequent drills are introduced in series of increasing size. Drills are usually made of stainless steel.\\nCover screw: Implant surgery is usually done in two stages. In the first stage the implant is inserted in the bone and left to integrate for a period of 2 months.\\n---\\n|A|B|C|\\n|---|---|---|\\n|12A to C|(A) Regular healing abutments.

The cover screw prevents bony ingrowth and keeps the abutment chamber patent while the implant is integrating.\\nThe healing abutment is usually placed 2–3 months later at the second stage. The cover screw of the buried implant is exposed. The cover screw is removed and a healing abutment placed instead. The healing abutment exposes the implant to the oral cavity (12C) and prepares the space for the future abutment. The healing abutment may be cylindrical or anatomic in design (Figs. 26.12A and B).',\n",

It is one of the factors which help in proper functioning, stability and longevity of the implant. The abutment is secured to the implant with the help of a screw. During occlusal function considerable stress may be transferred to the screw and can lead to its early loosening or even fracture. Manufacturers have, therefore, incorporated certain design features to reduce the stress on the abutment screw.\\nThe implant/abutment interface determines joint strength, stability, and lateral and rotational stability. It also reduces stress on the abutment screw.\\n---\\n# 12-point internal connection\\n|Internal hex|Internal pentagon|\\n|---|---|\\n|External hex|Internal tripod|\\n13 Various types of implant abutment connections.\\n# EXTERNAL HEX\\nThe original Brånemark protocol required several externally hexed implants to restore fully edentulous arches (13).\\n# INTERNAL HEX\\nOne of the first internally connected implants was designed with a 1.7-mm-deep hex below a 0.5 mm wide, 45° bevel. Its features were intended to distribute intraoral forces deeper within the implant to protect the retention screw from excess loading, and to reduce the potential of microleakage. Internally connected implants also provide superior strength for the implant/abutment connection.',\n",
       " 'Since the introduction of the internal connection concept, further design enhancements have been made in an attempt to enhance the implant/abutment connection. Included in such efforts is the “Morse” taper, wherein a tapered abutment post is inserted into the nonthreaded shaft of a dental implant with the same taper. Other internal connection designs have followed, frequently with variations in the numbers of hexes, connection length, angulation, etc.\\n- 3 point internal tripod — Replace select (Noble Biocare)\\n- 5 point internal pentagon — Tiologic (Dentaurum)\\n- 6 point internal hex — Frialit 2 (Friadent)\\n- 8 point internal morse taper — (ITI) Straumann\\n- 12 point conical seal — Astra (Astra Tech)\\n# PLATFORM SWITCHING\\nPlatform switching is a method used to preserve alveolar bone levels around dental implants. The concept refers to placing an abutment of narrower diameter on implants of wider diameter (Figs. 26.14A and B), rather than placing abutments of similar diameters (referred to as platform matching - 15).\\n# BIOINTEGRATION AND OSSEOINTEGRATION\\nFor an implant to function, it must integrate with the oral tissues.

Recently there has been interest in coating titanium with certain materials that actively promote a favorable bone response. These are referred to as ‘bioactive’. Examples of bioactive materials are hydroxyapatite, tricalcium phosphate and bioactive glasses. Commercially available bioactive glasses include Bioglass, Ceravital, Biogran and glass ceramic A-W. These materials are generally too weak and brittle to stand alone. However, when used as a coating (50 to 75 μm) on the surface of titanium, it combines the strength of titanium with its bioactive qualities. If successful, the ceramic coating becomes completely fused with the surrounding bone. In this case the interphase is termed ‘biointegration’ because there is no intervening space between the bone and the implant. Implant material and design is continually evolving. With every passing year the failure rates are gradually reducing. Current implants enjoy a 95 to 98% clinical success rate. More advances in both design, material and technique may be expected in the future.\\n---\\n# TITANIUM ALLERGY',\n",
       " '---\\n# TITANIUM ALLERGY\\nIn the last couple of years, the question if titanium allergy really exists has been raised in scientific literature. The reactions are not necessarily local, but appear in other parts of the body. One of the reasons why the existence of titanium allergy has been debated might be that the golden standard for metal allergy testing, patch testing, has not been properly developed for titanium. The patch test is a skin test, where salts of the metals tested are placed on the skin of the back under occlusion. 24–72 hours later a dermatologist evaluates the reaction and the presence of a rash is taken as evidence of a positive reaction. Unfortunately, titanium dioxide, a salt of titanium used for patch testing, does not penetrate the skin under the conditions of the patch test. This is one of the reasons why the patch test in its current form often gives false negative results in patients with titanium-induced inflammation in the body.\\nThe latest available research from Europe and Japan shows that between 2–4% of all patients with titanium implants develop an allergic reaction to either titanium or to one or more of the metals used in the titanium alloy. The symptoms most often observed after implantation with titanium-containing implants are varied, so they will be different in different patients. In addition to symptoms shown adjacent to implants on the mucosa in the mouth, or on the skin on the body, there may be other systemic symptoms. These symptoms are akin to those described after the exposure to other allergens, like nickel or mercury, in sensitized individuals. Symptoms arise because stimulated lymphocytes produce cytokines, which in turn, affect the HPA-axis. The result is multiple nonspecific symptoms such as profound fatigue, pain, cognitive dysfunction, headache, sleep problems, etc.',\n",
       " 'Allergy due to titanium might be accountable for the failure of implants in some cases (known as cluster patients). It has been documented that the risk of titanium allergy is more prevalent in patients having sensitivity to other metals. In such types of cases, an allergy assessment is suggested to exclude problems related to titanium implants.\\n# ZIRCONIA IMPLANTS\\nAlthough titanium is the preferred choice for dental implants as it is an inert material, in rare circumstances it may encourage toxic or allergic type I or IV reactions. Its high strength, fracture toughness, and its white color make zirconia an interesting material for the construction of implant abutments and superstructures especially in the anterior zone.\\n17 Zirconia one-piece implant with abutment.\\n# ZIRCONIA ANATOMIC ROOT-FORM IMPLANTS\\n---\\n# 18A And B\\n(A) Zirconia root form implants.\\n(B) Periapical view.\\nExtraction, its excellent biomechanical characteristics, biocompatibility, and bright tooth-like color, zirconia has the potential to become a substitute for titanium as dental implant material. Immediate placement of implant similar in shape and size to the extracted root has its own advantages. By adapting the root to the extraction socket instead of adapting the bone to a preformed standardized implant they reduced the bone and soft tissue trauma. Immediate custom-made root analogue implants were possible because of advances in material and CAD/CAM technology.

The particles are projected through a nozzle at high velocity by means of compressed air. This is followed by washing in nonetching acid and distilled water to remove residual blasting material. The microtextured surfaces have been shown to allow for increased bone apposition compared to machined surfaces by increasing the surface area. Some manufacturers combine both blasting and etching.\\n# Grit blasting materials\\nIn the case of alumina, residual blasting media is often embedded into the implant surface and can interfere with integration.\\n20A to e: Various implant surfaces with higher magnification.\\n|A Machined|B Sand blasted, large surface|C Acid etched (SLA)|\\n|---|---|---|\\n|D Anodized|E Plasma sprayed coating| |\\n---\\nThe implant surface can be roughened through acid etching (20C) with sulphuric or hydrochloric acids.\\n- Produces a cleaner surface as there is no possibility of an external agent embedding onto the implant surface.\\n- No possibility of loss of the layer through debonding, dissolution or wear thus avoiding concerns of long term fixation.\\nAnodizing is an electrochemical process used to increase the thickness of the natural oxide layer on the surface of the titanium (to more than 1000 nm). Anodization modifies the microstructure and crystallinity of the titanium oxide layer (20D). Anodization is done with the help of strong acids (e.g., sulphuric, phosphoric, nitric acids, etc.) at high current density and voltage (200 A/m2 at 100 V).',\n",
       " 'Shot peening is similar to sand blasting, where the surface is bombarded with small spherical particles causing small indentations to form. Laser peening involves the use of high intensity pulses of laser to create a regular honeycomb pattern with small pores.\\nHydroxyapatite (HA) (also called hydroxylapatite or calcium hydroxide phosphate), is a naturally occurring mineral form of calcium apatite with the formula Ca10(PO4)6(OH). Bone is a specialized mineralized connective tissue consisting by weight of 33% organic matrix, permeated by HA, which makes up the remaining 67% of bone. For this reason, HA is being investigated as a possible material for coatings or composites.\\nThe use of hydroxyapatite implants have been reported to stimulate bone healing, resulting in an improvement in the rate and strength of initial implant integration. Hence, the dense HA layer on the top of titanium substrate is mainly for biointegration to bone tissue and enhanced implant stability. Thus, it is believed that the use of HA coatings on metallic implants would speed rehabilitation of patients by decreasing the time from implant insertion to final reconstruction.\\nNumerous methods of depositing HA on metallic implants have been reported. The current deposition process is plasma spraying or arc plasma spraying. A gas stream (pure argon or a mix of argon/hydrogen) is used to carry HA powder, which is then passed through an electrical plasma produced by a low-voltage, high-current electrical discharge. The plasma heats the hydroxyapatite, partially melting it. The semimolten HA powder is sprayed onto the titanium where it solidify. It has been reported that plasma spraying of HA results in coatings with a uniform thickness.\\n---\\nthickness greater than 30 μm.

A wrought metal or alloy is one that has been worked, drawn or shaped into a serviceable form, e.g. plates, band materials, bars, and wires. The process of forming wrought metal objects has been known since ancient times. For example, swords used in warfare were formed by subjecting a hot piece of metal to a beating process. Other things used in daily life like farming equipment and kitchen utensils are also made by a similar process.\\n# Manufacture of Wrought Alloys\\n1. Round wires are obtained by drawing a cast alloy through a series of dies.\\n2. Rolling process is used to form sheets and rods.\\n3. Forging is a process by which an object is formed by compressing the parent metal between two dies. Stainless steel crowns are made by this process.\\nManufacture of wrought alloys results in a tremendous amount of stresses (known as work hardening). These stresses are relieved by heat treatment during or after manufacture.\\n---\\n# Structure of Wrought Alloys\\nAll alloys are initially formed by casting. When a cast metal is subject to any deformation, it is considered a wrought metal. Wrought alloys have a fibrous structure which result from the cold working applied during the drawing operation to shape the wire. At the atomic level the deformative processes involved in the manufacture of wrought alloys results in various types of atomic deformations and disruptions. These include dislocations, twinning, and fracture.\\n# Dislocations',\n",
       " '# Dislocations\\nOn application of a shear force, dislocation of the atoms occurs along a plane called as the slip plane. The simplest type of dislocation is known as edge dislocation. The dominant slip planes are characteristic for each type of crystal structure. For example, face-centered cubic (fcc) structures have the greatest number of slip planes. Therefore, metals with a fcc structure like gold, copper, nickel, palladium, silver, platinum, etc. are highly ductile and easy to draw. Body-centered cubic (bcc) metal have intermediate levels of ductility. Hexagonal close-packed structures (hcp) have the least amount of slip systems and therefore are relatively brittle, e.g. zinc. Dislocations occur only in materials having a crystalline structure. Dislocations cannot exist in materials with a noncrystalline structure like dental ceramics and polymeric materials.\\n# Twinning\\nAnother type of permanent deformation is known as twinning. The deformation occurs along either side of a plane in such a way that it mirrors each other. Twinning is favored over dislocation in metals that have relatively few slip systems.\\n# Fracture\\nContinuation of cold working in a heavily deformed metal eventually leads to fracture. The fracture initiates from microcracks that occur at points where there is an accumulation of dislocations or at boundaries between different microstructural phases. Alloys can undergo brittle or ductile fracture depending on a variety of factors, such as composition, microstructure, and strain rate. When a ductile alloy fractures under tension, there is a reduction in the diameter of the metal (necking down) at the fracture site prior to fracture. Ductile fracture sites are characterized by a dimpled morphology. Microvoids or porosities may be seen at the fracture site.',\n",
       " 'Fracture due to cold working is a cause for concern in dentistry. Examples are fractures of endodontic instruments like root canal files and reamers within the canal. Retrieval of such instruments can often be difficult. That is why it is necessary to use these instruments in the correct sequence and manner and to change these instruments at regular intervals rather than use them till it breaks.\\n# Annealing\\nThe effects of cold working like strain hardening, susceptibility to corrosion, and loss of ductility can be neutralized by a heating process called annealing.\\n# Stages of Annealing\\n---\\n# Recrystallization\\nThe time and temperature for annealing is dependent on the melting temperature of the alloy. A commonly observed rule is to use a temperature that is approximately half the melting point of the metal or alloy on the absolute scale (K).\\n# Recovery\\nIn the recovery stage, there is a slight decrease in tensile strength with no change in ductility. The most important beneficial changes occur during the recovery phase. As mentioned earlier, cold worked metal contains a lot of residual stresses. The purpose of annealing heat treatment is to relieve these stresses. Maximum stress relief occurs during the recovery stage.\\n# Recrystallization\\nOn further heating, changes in the microstructure begin to take place. The deformed grains begin to recrystallize forming new stress free grains. The metal essentially regains its old soft and ductile condition. The metal loses its properties of resilience rendering it useless for its intended purpose. Thus recrystallization must be avoided.\\n# Grain Growth\\nIn this phase the recrystallized grains continue to grow with larger grains consuming smaller grains. Grain growth does not proceed indefinitely, but rather ceases until a coarse grain structure is formed. There is no significant difference in ductility and tensile strength from that observed in the previous stage.',\n",
       " 'Significance: It is clear from the above that annealing should be done only until the recovery stage. Uncontrolled heating of dental related appliances can result in unintended changes within the structure.\\n# Uses of Wrought Alloys\\n- Orthodontic wires\\n- Prosthodontic clasps\\n- Root canal instruments like files and reamers\\n- Steel bands and brackets for orthodontic and pedodontic use\\n- Stainless steel crowns\\n- Dental instruments\\n# Orthodontic Wires\\nVarious types of wires are used in fixed and removable orthodontics for tooth movement and stabilization.\\n# Classification (ISO 15841:2014)\\nWires are classified on the basis of their elastic behavior.\\n|Type 1 wires:|Wires displaying linear elastic behavior during unloading at temperatures up to 50 °C.|\\n|---|---|\\n|Type 2 wires:|Wires displaying nonlinear elastic behavior during unloading at temperatures up to 50 °C.|\\n---\\n# General Properties of Orthodontic Wires\\n- Force generated: The force generated by the wire on the tooth is dependent on its composition and design. For a given design, the force generated is proportional to the wire’s stiffness.\\n- Elastic deflection and working range: Biologically, low constant forces are less damaging. This is best achieved by a large elastic deflection because it produces a more constant force and has a greater ‘working range’.

Because of the cold working, wires and other wrought forms have improved mechanical properties like hardness and tensile strength when compared to cast structures.

When chromium (12 to 30%) is added to steel, the alloy is called as stainless steel. Elements other than iron, carbon and chromium may also be present, resulting in a wide variation in composition and properties of the stainless steels.\\n# passivation',\n",
       " '# passivation\\nStainless steels are resistant to tarnish and corrosion, because of the passivating effect of the chromium. A thin, transparent but tough and impervious oxide layer forms on the surface of the alloy when it is exposed to air, which protects it against tarnish and corrosion. It loses its protection if the oxide layer is ruptured by mechanical or chemical factors.\\n# types\\n---\\n# Austenitic\\n|Composition|Chromium - 18%|\\n|---|---|\\n| |nickel - 8%|\\n| |Carbon - 0.08-0.15%|\\nUses: This alloy is also known as 18-8 stainless steel.

So they find little application in dentistry.\\n# Martensitic stainless steels\\nWhen austenite (face-centered cubic structure) is cooled very rapidly (quenched), it will undergo a spontaneous, diffusionless transformation to a body-centered tetragonal (BCT) structure called martensite. This is a highly distorted and strained lattice, which results in a very hard and strong but brittle alloy.\\nProperties and uses: Corrosion resistance of the martensitic stainless steel is less than that of the other types. Because of their high strength and hardness, martensitic stainless steels are used for surgical and cutting instruments. Bur shanks are also made from this steel.\\n# Austenitic stainless steels',\n",
       " '# Austenitic stainless steels\\nAt temperatures between 912 °C and 1394 °C, the stable form of iron is a face-centered cubic (FCC) structure called austenite. The austenitic stainless steel alloys are the most corrosion resistant of the stainless steels.\\nAustenite-finish temperature: It is the temperature at which the metallurgical transformation from the low-temperature martensite phase to the high-temperature austenite phase is completed.\\n---\\n1 A stainless steel wire roll (left) and some of the appliances made from the wires.\\n|Advantages|Drawbacks|\\n|---|---|\\n|Austenitic steel is preferred to ferritic alloys because of some desirable properties| |\\n|1.

Comparative ease in forming.| |\\n2 High tensile stainless steel wire.\\nThe 18-8 stainless steel may lose its resistance to corrosion if it is heated between 400 and 900 °C (temperature used during soldering and welding).\\nThe reason for a decrease in corrosion resistance is the precipitation of chromium carbide at the grain boundaries at these high temperatures. The small, rapidly diffusing carbon atoms migrate to the grain boundaries from all parts of the crystal to combine with the large, slowly diffusing chromium atoms at the periphery of the grain. When the chromium combines with the carbon in this manner, its passivating qualities are lost and the corrosion resistance of the steel is reduced.\\n1. From a theoretical point, the carbon content of the steel can be reduced to such an extent that carbide precipitation cannot occur. However, this is not economically practical.',\n",

By stabilization, i.e., some element is introduced that precipitates as a carbide in preference to chromium. Titanium is commonly used. Titanium at six times the carbon content, inhibits the precipitation of chromium carbide at soldering temperatures. These are known as stabilized stainless steels.\\n---\\nis available in different grades depending on their yield strength.

These braided or twisted wires are able to sustain large elastic deflections in bending, and apply low forces for a given deflection when compared with solid stainless steel wire.\\nSilver solders are used.

The wires are usually heat treated and supplied in several degrees of hardness (soft, ductile, semispring temper, and spring temper).\\nTarnish and corrosion resistance is excellent. Hardness, yield, and tensile strength similar to those of 18-8 stainless steel.\\nNickel-titanium shape memory alloys were first discovered by Buehler in the early 1960s. He was working at the Naval Ordinance Laboratory (NOL) at the time, hence the name nitinol. His discovery formed the basis of the first commercial shape memory alloy. These nickel-titanium alloy (also called nitinol) wires have large elastic deflections or working range and limited formability because of their low stiffness and moderately high strength. They are used extensively as arch wires in fixed orthodontic treatment. They are also used to manufacture endodontic instruments.\\nNickel titanium alloy wires are available as springs in addition to formed arch wires. Nickel titanium wires are commercially available in martensitic (M-niti) and austenitic (A-niti) depending on their use in different phases of orthodontic treatment.\\nThe primary elements are nickel and titanium. Addition of copper to nickel and titanium alloy improves the thermal reactive properties of the wire, which help in consistent and efficient orthodontic tooth movement. Other additions made to alter the phase transformation temperature are elements such as iron and chromium which lower the temperature.\\n5 Nickel-titanium files.\\n---\\nvolumetric change. This behavior of the alloy (austenite to martensite phase transition) results in two features of clinical significance called as ‘shape memory’ and ‘superelasticity’, or ‘pseudoelasticity’.',\n",
       " 'The ‘memory’ effect is achieved by first establishing a shape at temperatures near 482 °C. The appliance, e.g. archwire is then cooled and formed into a second shape. Subsequent heating through a lower transition temperature (37 °C - mouth temperature) causes the wire to return to its original shape. The phenomenon of superelasticity is produced by transition of austenite to martensite by stress due to the volume change which results from the change in crystal structure.\\nStressing an alloy initially results in standard proportional stress-strain behavior. however, at the stress where it induces the phase transformation, there is an increase in strain, referred to as superelasticity. At the completion of the phase, it reverts to standard proportional stress-strain behavior. Unloading results in the reverse transition and recovery. This characteristic is useful in some orthodontic situations because it results in low forces and a very large working range or springback.\\nThese wires are useful because it is possible to achieve phase transformation at room temperature when force is applied. Wires with different transformation temperatures are now available, which enable the clinician to select the precise wires for different needs.\\n|Density|Their density is approximately 6.5 g/cm3.|\\n|---|---|\\n|Melting range|Melting temperature in the range 1240 to 1310 °C.|\\nLike stainless steel and nitinol, pure titanium has different crystallographic forms at high and low temperatures.

One might argue that composite resins have a similar esthetic potential. However, there is a difference—dental ceramics are far more stronger, durable, wear resistant, and virtually indestructible in the oral environment. They are impervious to oral fluids and absolutely biocompatible. They do have some drawbacks which will be discussed subsequently. Because of their huge potential, it is still a fast growing area in terms of research and development.

Ceramic orthodontic brackets.\\nCeramics are among the oldest materials known to man. Ceramic objects dating back to 20,000 years have been found in China. The history of glass dates back to 3500 BC in Mesopotamia. The term ‘glass’ was first developed during the late Roman empire. Ceramics comes from Greek word keramikos, which means pottery and keramos, which means potter’s clay.\\nAn esthetic and durable material that could accurately reproduce missing teeth or teeth structure had always been a dream. Prior to the use of porcelain, crowns were made entirely of gold or other alloys. As demands for esthetics increased, tooth colored resin was used as a veneer over the metal in the esthetic areas. Around the early 1900s, porcelain crowns were introduced to dentistry by Charles Land (grandfather of aviator Charles Lindbergh) who coined the term porcelain jacket crowns (PJC). The restoration was extensively used after improvements were made by EB Spaulding and publicized by WA Capon. While not known for its strength due to internal microcracking, the porcelain “jacket” crown (PJC) was used extensively until the 1950s. These early crowns were made of feldspathic porcelains which generally were materials of poor strength. They were also very difficult to fabricate and did not fit well (poor margins).',\n",
       " 'To reduce the risk of internal microcracking during the cooling phase of fabrication, the porcelain-fused-to-metal (PFM) crown was developed in the late 1950s by Abraham Weinstein. The bond between the metal and porcelain prevented stress cracks from forming. This led to the era of the metal-ceramics. Prior to this, metal FDPs were veneered (covered) with tooth colored acrylic in order to hide the metal. These veneers did not last very long and had to be replaced often. Besides they could not be used to cover the occlusal surface because of their poor wear resistance. The metal-ceramic crowns and fixed dental prostheses were instantly accepted because of their superior esthetics, wear resistance and strength. The ceramic could be used to veneer the occlusal surface as well. Since the margins were in metal, the marginal fit was highly accurate.\\nIn spite of the success of the metal-ceramic restorations, they did not represent the final solution. The underlying opaquer covered metal did not allow the natural passage and reflection of light as in natural teeth. Under certain lighting conditions these crowns appeared dense, dark and opaque. The margin of the restoration appeared to be dark, even when hidden below the gums as it sometimes showed through the gums (the gums developed a bluish discoloration).\\n1 Porcelain-fused-to-metal fixed partial denture.\\n---\\nA portion of the metal was removed from the labial margin (metal free margin) and replaced with shoulder porcelain. However, this still did not entirely solve the problem of translucency. The first breakthrough at developing a stronger all-ceramic restoration came in 1965. McLean and Hughes introduced an alumina reinforced core material which improved the strength of the porcelain. However, they were still not strong enough for posterior use and of course the problem of marginal adaptation still remained.',\n",
       " 'The 1990s saw the reemergence of the all-ceramic crown as well as small fixed partial dentures. The strength of the restorations had been improved through the introduction of newer porcelains and fabrication techniques. The marginal adaptation and fit had also improved considerably when compared to the first generation all-porcelain crowns. The new generation ceramics included castable glass ceramics, injection molded ceramics, glass infiltrated core ceramics, CAD/CAM (computer-aided design, computer-aided machining) ceramics, etc. With the increase in strength the use of all ceramic restorations gradually expanded to include posterior crowns and bridges. A major reason for this was the introduction of stabilized zirconia and CAD/CAM. Ceramic technology continue to evolve because of the high demand for esthetic tooth colored restorations.\\nCompounds of one or more metals with a nonmetallic element, usually oxygen. They are formed of chemical and biochemical stable substances that are strong, hard, brittle, and inert nonconductors of thermal and electrical energy (GPT- 8).\\n# CLASSIFICATION OF DENTAL PORCELAINS\\nThe wide variety of ceramic systems available in the market make classification of ceramics a challenging task.

The basic structure therefore consists of a three-dimensional network of silica (silica tetrahedra). Pure glass melts at too high a temperature for dental use. Adding certain chemicals lowers the melting temperature by disrupting the silica network. The glass obtains porcelain-like qualities when the silica network is broken by alkalies like sodium and potassium. This also lowers the fusion temperature. These chemicals are known as glass modifiers or fluxes. Other substances that act as glass modifiers are alumina (AlO) and boric oxide (BO). Boric oxide forms its own separate network between 2 and 3.\\n---\\n# Glass\\n|Random amorphous (noncrystalline) structure|Ordered crystalline structure in glassy matrix|\\n|---|---|\\n|Transparent|Opaque|\\n|Composed mainly of silica|Contains silica and other crystalline phases|\\nThe silica network.

Most of the components needed to make dental porcelain are found in feldspar. It thus contains potash (K2O), soda (Na2O), alumina (Al2O3), and silica (SiO2). It is the basic glass former. When fused at high temperatures (during manufacture) it forms a feldspathic glass containing potash feldspar (K2O.Al2O3.6SiO2) or soda feldspar (Na2O.Al2O3.6SiO2). Pure feldspathic glass is quite colorless and transparent. As explained earlier, various glass modifiers and opacifiers are added to alter its sintering temperature, viscosity, thermal coefficient of expansion (CTE), and appearance.\\n# Kaolin\\nKaolin also called china clay, is a white clay-like material (hydrated aluminum silicate). Kaolin is named after the hill in China (Kao-ling) from which it was mined for centuries. It acts as a binder when wet, helping to shape the green porcelain. It also gives opacity to the mass. Some manufacturers use sugar or starch instead of kaolin.\\n# Quartz\\nQuartz is a form of silica. Ground quartz acts as a refractory skeleton, providing strength and hardness to porcelain during firing. It remains relatively unchanged during and after firing.\\n# Alumina\\nAluminum oxide (alumina) replaces some of the silica in the glass network. It gives strength and opacity to the porcelain. It alters the softening point and increases the viscosity of porcelain during firing.\\n---\\nlattice) interspersed between the silica network (lattice).\\n# Glass modifiers\\n- It reduces the chemical durability of the ceramic\\n- It may cause the glass to devitrify (crystallize)\\n# Opacifiers',\n",

Oxides of zirconium, titanium and tin are commonly used opacifiers.\\n# Color modifiers\\nNatural teeth come in a variety of shades. In addition, it acquires external stains from the environment. Thus, color modifiers are required to adjust the shades of the dental ceramic. Various metallic oxides provide a variety of color, e.g. titanium oxide (yellow-brown), nickel oxide (brown), copper oxide (green), manganese oxide (lavender), cobalt oxide (blue), etc. They are fused together with regular feldspar and then reground and blended to produce a variety of colors.\\n# OTHER SPECIALIZED PORCELAINS\\nIt is a special type of colorless porcelain applied to the surface of the completed ceramic restoration to give it a smooth finish as well as increase the life of the restoration. Obviously they do not contain opacifiers. They must also have a lower fusion temperature and therefore must contain a lot of glass modifiers. This also makes them somewhat less chemically durable.\\nThey are porcelain powders containing a high concentration of color modifiers (as described previously). They too have a lower fusion temperature made possible by an increased content of glass modifiers. Stains are used to provide individual color variation in the finished restoration (2).\\nIt is a specialized type of porcelain which is used to conceal the metal core in PFM (metal-ceramic) restorations. It is the first layer applied before the addition of the regular porcelain. Obviously, it contains a high concentration of opacifiers. Some amount of color modifiers are also added.',\n",
       " 'The low strength of traditional feldspathic porcelain prompted research into methods of reinforcing ceramics. The first reinforced ceramic (alumina reinforced) was introduced by McLean and Hughes in 1965. Subsequently other materials and techniques were introduced. Among the strongest of the core ceramics currently available are the machined zirconia cores.\\n---\\nTraditionally, porcelain powders are manufactured by a process called fritting. Various components are mixed together and fused. While it is still hot, it is quenched in water. This causes the mass to crack and fracture, making it easier to powder it. The frit is ground to a fine powder and supplied to the consumer in bottles. Most of the chemical reaction takes place during the manufacture (pyrochemical reaction). During subsequent firing in the dental laboratory, there is not much of chemical reaction). The porcelain powder simply fuses together to form the desired restoration.\\n# PORCELAIN/CERAMIC SYSTEMS\\nCurrently, various ceramic systems exist which can be quite confusing to the dental student. The entire restoration may be made of just one type of porcelain Core (e.g. an inlay machined from a single block of ceramic) or it may be layered Veneer with different types of porcelains. Many crowns and FDPs are fabricated as layered restorations. A layered restoration can be divided into 2 basic parts.\\nVeneer (outer layer).\\n3 Simplified structure of a ceramic crown.\\n# Core',\n",
       " 'Veneer (outer layer).\\n3 Simplified structure of a ceramic crown.\\n# Core\\nThe core provides support and strength for the crown. Early crowns were constructed entirely of a single type of feldspathic porcelain (e.g. PJC). In 1965 McLean demonstrated improved strength in crowns layered over an aluminous core. Since then other core materials and techniques have been introduced. The core functions as a supporting frame. Freshly mixed porcelain is like wet sand. It needs to be supported while it is being condensed and built up. The core is therefore usually constructed first. The rest of the restoration is built up on to the core.\\nWith metal-ceramic crowns the metal coping or frame takes the role of the ceramic core. They provide the support and reinforcement. Examples of core materials currently available are alumina, spinel, zirconia, etc.\\n# Veneer\\nThe core is usually dense and opaque and generally unesthetic. The esthetics is improved by firing additional layers of ceramic known as veneer porcelains. The core is veneered with various layers of specialized porcelains called dentin, enamel, cervical and translucent. It can also be internally and externally (surface) stained to mimic natural teeth color and finally glazed.\\n# CLASSIFICATION AND DESCRIPTION OF CERAMIC SYSTEMS\\nThe ceramic restorations available today may be metal bonded or made completely of ceramic. Based on the substructure or core material used there are two basic groups. They are further divided based on the fabrication method.\\n- Cast noble metal alloys\\n---\\n- Cast titanium (ultra low fusing porcelain).\\n|2.|Burnished foil metal ceramic restorations|\\n|---|---|\\n| |- Capillary casting [sintered gold alloy foil coping Renaissance, Captek)]|\\n| |- Bonded platinum foil coping.|\\n|1.|Platinum foil matrix condensed porcelain restorations|\\n|---|---|\\n| |- Conventional feldspathic porcelain restorations|\\n| |- Porcelain restorations with aluminous core|',\n",

The metal-ceramic restorations (4) were developed around the same time Mclean introduced the aluminous core porcelains (1965). The cast metal core (called coping) or framework (5) significantly strengthened the porcelain restoration and this soon became the most widely used ceramic restoration. According to a 1994 survey, 90% of all ceramic restorations were porcelain-fused-to-metal. The metal-ceramic systems are covered by ISO 9693. The metal-ceramic system was possible because of some important developments.\\n- Development of a metal and porcelain that could bond to each other',\n",

It is mixed with the liquid to produce a sandy mix. A glass spatula is used for mixing as metal might abrade and contaminate the porcelain.\\n---\\nA clean metal surface is essential for good bonding. Oil and other impurities from the fingers can contaminate. The surface is finished with ceramic bonded stones or sintered diamonds. Final texturing is done by sandblasting with an alumina air abrasive, which aids in the bonding. Finally, it is cleaned ultrasonically, washed and dried.\\nThe casting (gold porcelain systems) is heated to a high temperature (980°C) to burn off the impurities and to form an oxide layer which help in the bonding. Degassing is done in the porcelain furnace.',\n",
       " 'The opaquer is a dense yellowish white powder supplied along with a special liquid. The opaquer has two important functions. It is used to cover (mask) the metal frame and prevent it from being visible. It also aids in bonding the veneering porcelains to the underlying frame. The metal framework is held with a pair of locking forceps. Opaquer powder is dispensed on to a ceramic palette and mixed with the special liquid to a paste like consistency. It is applied on to the metal frame with a brush and condensed. The excess liquid is blotted with a tissue paper. The opaquer is built up to a thickness of 0.2 mm. The casting with the opaquer is placed in a porcelain furnace and fired at the appropriate temperature. Opaquer may be completed in two steps.\\nThe process of packing the powder particles together and removing the excess water is known as condensation.\\nProper condensation packs the particles together. This helps minimize porosity, improve strength and reduce firing shrinkage. It also helps remove the excess water.\\nVibration - Mild vibration by tapping or running a serrated instrument on the forceps holding the metal frame helps to pack the particles together and bring out the excess water which is then blotted by an absorbent paper. An ultrasonic vibrator is also available for this purpose.\\n---\\nThe process of sintering and fusing the particles of the condensed mass is known as firing. The powder particles flow and fuse together during firing, making the restoration dense and strong. Firing is done in a porcelain furnace.\\nFiring is carried out in a porcelain furnace. There are many companies which manufacture furnaces. Modern furnaces are computer controlled and have built-in programs to control the firing cycle. The programs can also be modified by the operator.',\n",
       " 'The entire program of preheating, firing, subjecting to vacuum, subjecting to increased pressure, holding, and controlled cooling is known as a firing cycle. The firing cycles vary depending on the stage - opaquer firing, dentin firing, glaze firing, etc. The firing temperature is lowered gradually for each subsequent firing cycle. The opaquer has the highest temperature and the glaze has the lowest.\\nThe condensed mass should not be placed directly into the hot furnace. This can cause a rapid formation of steam which can break up the mass. Modern furnaces have a mechanism whereby the work is gradually raised into the furnace. This is known as preheating.\\nDuring firing of the porcelain, a vacuum (negative pressure) is created in the furnace. This helps to reduce the porosity in the ceramic. The vacuum is later released raising the pressure in the furnace. The increased pressure helps to further reduce the size of any residual air bubbles not eliminated by the vacuum. The vacuum is not activated during the glaze firing.\\nThe cooling of the fired porcelain should be well controlled. Rapid cooling can cause the porcelain to crack or it can induce stresses inside which weaken the porcelain. Cooling is done slowly and uniformly and is usually computer controlled.\\n|Spatulation| |\\n|---|---|\\n|A small spatula is used to apply and smoothen the wet porcelain.

A glass spatula should be used (ceramic powder is abrasive and can abrade the metal and contaminate the porcelain). The bulk of the tooth is built up with dentin. A portion of the dentin in the incisal area is cut back and enamel porcelain (white powder) can be added building the restoration. After the build-up and condensation is over, it is returned to the furnace for sintering.\\nIt is not necessary to build up the restoration in one step. Large or difficult restorations may be built up and fired in two or more stages. After each firing, the porcelain may be shaped by grinding and additional porcelain is placed in deficient areas. Each additional firing is done at a lower temperature.\\nThe restoration should not be subject to too many firings. Excessive firings can give rise to an over translucent, lifeless restoration.\\n---\\n# 14A AND B\\n|A|Stained porcelain crown.

       " 'Natural teeth come in a variety of hues and colors. Some of them are present at the time of eruption (intrinsic, e.g. white fluorosis stains), while others are acquired over a period of time from the environment (extrinsic, e.g. coffee, tobacco, etc.). Staining and characterization helps make the restoration look natural and helps it to blend in with the adjacent teeth. The stain powders are mixed with a special liquid, applied and blended with a brush.\\n15 Porcelain stains and glazes.\\nWith more and more emphasis on recreating the natural look, effects are created using special techniques. This includes defects, cracks or other anomalies within the enamel.\\nBefore final glazing, the restoration is tried in the mouth by the dentist. The occlusion is checked and adjusted by grinding. Final alterations can be made to improve the shape of the restoration. After all changes have been completed the restoration is ready for glazing.

The system was developed by Shoher and Whiteman and introduced to the dental community in 1993. Captek is an acronym for ‘capillary casting technique’. The technique is used to make crowns and fixed prostheses using proprietary materials and techniques (Figs. 28.17A to C). (Refer chapter on ‘casting procedures’ for additional information).\\nThey are supplied as thin strips in two forms called Captek P and Captek G. Captek P (Platinum/Palladium/Gold) has a porous structure and serves as the internal reinforcing skeleton. Captek G is 97.5% Gold and 2.5% Silver. On heating in a furnace, the Captek P acts like a metal sponge and draws in (capillary action) the hot liquid gold completely into it. Captek G provides the characteristic gold color of this system.

       " '# Traditional Porcelain Jacket Crown\\nThe all-porcelain crown (PJC) has been around since a century (early 1900s). These early crowns are also referred to as traditional or conventional PJCs. They were made from conventional high fusing feldspathic porcelains. As mentioned before these were very brittle and fractured easily (half moon fractures). The marginal adaptation was also quite poor. Because of these problems they gradually lost popularity and are no longer used presently.\\n# Porcelain Jacket Crown with Aluminous Core\\nThe problems associated with traditional PJCs led to the development of the PJC with an alumina reinforced core (McLean and Hughes, 1965). The increased content of alumina crystals (40 to 50%) in the core strengthened the porcelain by interruption of crack propagation. In spite of the increased strength they were still brittle and therefore not indicated for posterior teeth and their use was restricted to anterior teeth. The composition of the alumina reinforced PJC is shown in Table 28.2.\\nTechnical considerations: The porcelain jacket crowns are made using the platinum foil matrix technique.\\nPlatinum foil matrix: A platinum foil is adapted to the die with a wooden point.

The subsequent ‘ceramming’ process is also quite unique to this porcelain. Ceramming enhances the growth of mica crystals within the ceramic.\\n---\\nGlass ceramics are materials that are formed initially as glass, and then transformed into ceramic usually by a controlled heat treatment. The heat induces partial devitrification (crystallization within the glass) which increases the strength as well as improves esthetics by making it less transparent and more tooth-like. The glass-ceramics used in dentistry include the castable, machinable and hot-isostatically pressed glass-ceramics.\\nThe first commercially available castable glass-ceramic for dental use was ‘Dicor’ developed by Corning glass works and marketed by Dentsply.

The glass infiltration process compensates for firing shrinkage. The final core after completion of the glass infiltration is made up of about 70% alumina and 30% (sodium lanthanum) glass.\\n2.

Two dies are required. One in stone and the other in refractory die material.\\n2. Preparing the slip—Measured quantity (38 g) of alumina powder is added slowly into a beaker containing 1 ampoule of mixing liquid and a drop of additive liquid. Mixing is done with the help of a special ultrasonic unit (Vitasonic). The water in the Vitasonic should be chilled using ice cubes. The prepared slip should be smooth and homogenous. The slip is applied on to the refractory die using the slip cast method (the water from the slurry is absorbed by the porous die leaving a dense layer of alumina on the surface). Once started the slip should not be allowed to dry out before the coping is completed. The process is continued until an alumina coping of sufficient thickness is obtained.\\n3. The fragile slip cast alumina coping is dried at 120 °C for 2 hours.\\n4. The coping is sintered (Inceramat furnace) for 10 hours at 1120 °C.\\n5. After sintering the copings are tested for cracks using a special dye.\\n6. The next step is glass infiltration. Glass powder is mixed with distilled water. One or two thick coats (1-2 mm) is applied on to the sintered alumina coping (outer surface only) and fired for 2-3 hours at 1110 °C on a platinum foil. The glass melts and infiltrates into the porous alumina coping through capillary action.',\n",
       " '7. The excess glass forms a glassy layer on the surface which is trimmed off using special diamond burs, followed by sandblasting. A glass control firing (1000 °C) is carried out.\\n8.

Where esthetics is absolutely critical.\\n# GLASS INFILTRATED SPINELL CORE (IN-CERAM SPINELL)\\nIn-Ceram Spinell is an offshoot of In-Ceram Alumina. Because of the comparatively high opacity of the alumina core, a new material was introduced known as In-Ceram spinell. It uses spinel (MgAlO4) instead of alumina. The fabrication process is quite similar to that for In-Ceram Alumina.\\n---\\nCeram Alumina core. Since the strength is lower, its use is limited to low stress situations.\\nIts high translucency makes it a material of choice for crowns and restorations in esthetic (anterior crowns) and stress-free zones.\\nThe high translucency contraindicates it in situations where the underlying tooth structure is severely discolored and needs to be masked. Its low strength also contraindicates it for posterior situations and FDPs.',\n",
       " 'Zirconia (ZrO) is a naturally occurring mineral. Crystals of Zirconia are used as a substitute for diamond. In-Ceram Zirconia is the strongest of the three glass infiltrated core materials. The final glass infiltrated ICZ cores contain around 30 wt% zirconia and 70 wt% alumina.\\nIts high strength makes it a material of choice for posterior crowns and short span fixed partial dentures in high-stress areas (posterior FDPs). It is not particularly suited for esthetic zones because of its greater opacity. However, in cases where there is severe discoloration, In-Ceram Zirconia helps mask the discolored tooth structure because of its greater opacity.\\nThese are systems that can design and produce restorations out of blocks or blanks of ceramics with the aid of a computer. CAD/CAM is an acronym for computer-aided design-computer-aided manufacturing.\\nThe major development in the field of dental CAD/CAM took place in the 1980s. They were influenced by three important pioneers. The first was Duret who fabricated crowns through a series of processes starting with an optical impression of the prepared tooth. The milling was done by a numerically controlled milling machine (the precursor of modern CAM/CAM). The second pioneer was Mörmann, developer of the CEREC system at the University of Zurich. A compact chair-side machine milled the crown from measurements of the preparation taken by an intraoral camera. At the time, the system was innovative as it allowed ‘same-day restorations’. With the announcement of this system, the term CAD/CAM spread rapidly to the dental profession. The third was Andersson, the developer of the Procera system in the 1980s.\\n---',\n",

The early systems had to overcome many problems including limited computing power, poor marginal accuracy, etc. Current CAD/CAM systems have come a long way. With improvements in technology, material and software, restoration fabrication is considerably more accurate and operator friendly as well. CAD/CAM systems are now part of everyday dentistry.\\nMany systems are currently available using a variety of techniques and materials (30). Some examples of commercially available CAD/CAM systems are - Cerec (Sirona), Sirona InLab, Everest (Kavo), Cercon (Dentsply), Lava (3M ESPE), Zeno (Weiland), 5-tec (Zirkonzahn), etc.\\n# ESSENTIALS OF A CAD/CAM SYSTEM\\n5.

Example - An inlay or laminate may be constructed entirely with pressable ceramics or from a machined feldspathic block.\\n- In many systems at least 2 or more processing techniques and materials have to be combined to produce the final restoration for a variety of reasons like esthetics, ease of fabrication, need for correction, etc.',\n",
       " 'Most reinforced core ceramics are too opaque to be used to construct the entire restoration with it. These cores have to be built up with veneering ceramics, characterized with stains and then glazed to produce the final restoration. Example 1—Glass infiltrated cores are too opaque and have to be layered with condensing type veneering porcelains to produce the final restoration. Example 2—Machined alumina cores are frequently built up with condensable ceramics. Example 3—In one system machined zirconia blocks are overlayed with a pressable veneering material (Zir Cad and Zir Pres).\\nAn important point to remember is that various ceramics should be compatible with each other when used together. Non-compatible products may have difference in CTE which can cause failure of the restoration. The manufacturers usually specify the veneering materials compatible with their products.\\n---\\nThe dimensions of the prepared tooth (or die or wax pattern) are picked up and digitized in order to create a 3-dimensional image of the prepared tooth in the computer. This is achieved by scanning of the preparation or the die.\\n1. Contact probes - Physically contacts the die as it moves along its surface while transmitting the information to the computer. E.g. Procera Forte contact scanner.\\n- Intraoral hand-held wands - These are chairside scanners. The intraoral scanner reflects light (visible light, laser or LED) and captures it with a camera to create an optical impression of the prepared tooth and adjacent structures. Multiple images have to be captured to stitch together a composite 3D image in the computer. In some systems a special powder is dusted to reduce reflection and improve readability.',\n",
       " '- Laboratory scanners - These are larger devices that scan the cast or die using different technologies. Some use a camera to capture multiple images similar to the intraoral scanner (white light optical scanner). Others use 2 cameras to capture the object from multiple angles using white light (e.g. Kavo Everest) or laser planes projected in a grid pattern. The Procera optical scanner uses a laser beam to measure distances (conoscopic holography).\\n|Scanning|Designing|Milling|\\n|---|---|---|\\n|A|B|C|\\n|D|E|F|\\n|G|H|I|\\n(A) Tooth preparation may be scanned directly in the mouth with a hand-held scanner.\\n(B) The preparation may also be scanned from a cast (Kavo scanner).\\n(C) A computer aids in designing the final restoration or coping.\\n(D) The design is transferred to the milling station and a restoration is milled.\\n(E) A milled laminate.\\n(F) cerec 3 (Sirona) inlab.\\n(G) Zeno 2100 (Weiland).\\n(H) Lava (3 M Espe).\\n(I) Everest (Kavo) milling station.\\n---\\n|A|B|\\n|---|---|\\n|32A AND B|(A) Light beam scanner (Kavo Everest).

The CAD process aids in designing either the restoration, coping or the FDP substructure. The computer can automatically detect the finish line. Some use a library of tooth shapes that is stored on the computer to suggest the shape of the proposed restoration. A recording of the bite registration (the imprint of the opposing or antagonist tooth in a wax-like or rubbery material) is also added to the data. The combined information together with the 3D optical impression of the prepared tooth establishes the approximate zone in which the new restoration can exist. The proposed restoration can then be morphed to fit into this zone in an anatomically and functionally correct position. The dentist can make corrections or modify the design if required and then send it to the milling unit for completion.',\n",
       " 'Milling stations have evolved considerably since they were first introduced into the market (Figs. 28.31E to I). The earlier models ground only the internal surface. The external surface had to be manually ground. Current CAD/CAM machines can grind the external surface also. Signals from the computer control the milling tool which shapes the ceramic block according to the computer generated design. To begin the process the ceramic block is attached to the machine via a frame or built-in handle(s). The enlargement factor (see presintered zirconia) is also calculated where applicable. Milling is performed by a diamond or carbide milling tool. The Cerec station (31F) uses 2 diamond burs to grind the internal and external surface simultaneously (31D). Other machines use a single tool that moves along multiple axis (3 to 5 axis) and performs the milling action. The Everest (Kavo) Engine (31I) is an example of a 5 axis milling action. Some machines (Kavo Everest) can mill both ceramic and titanium.\\nA variety of ceramic blanks in various sizes, shades and shapes are available for milling. Multiple units can be produced from the larger blocks. The smaller blanks may produce only a single coping or restoration. The blank is attached via a frame to the machine or by one or more handles on the blank itself.\\n|1.|Feldspathic porcelain blanks [Vitablocs Mark II (Vita)].|\\n|---|---|\\n|2.|Glass ceramic blanks - Tetrasilicic fluormica based glass ceramic [Dicor MGC (Dentsply)]|\\n---\\n- Lithia disilicate glass ceramic [IPS e max CAD (Kavo)].\\n- Alumina (Vita In-Ceram Alumina)\\n- Spinell (Vita In-Ceram Spinell)\\n- Zirconia (Vita In-Ceram Zirconia).\\n- Alumina (Vita In-Ceram AL)\\n- Ytrria stabilized Zirconia (Vita In-Ceram YZ).\\n- Ytrria stabilized Zirconia (Everest ZH blanks).',\n",

The prepared tooth or teeth is scanned directly from the mouth or from a model made from a regular impression. Next the restoration or substructure is designed on the computer. The blank is attached to the milling station and the bar code scanned. The time taken for milling depends on the size and complexity of the restoration as well as the material used. For example, presintered zirconia is easier to mill than sintered zirconia. It also reduces wear of the milling tools.\\nAfter milling, the structure is separated from the blank using water cooled cutting and grinding disc or burs.

Blank with bar code is shown on the inset.\\nFully dense zirconia is extremely difficult to machine, taking up to two hours just to fabricate a single unit. Therefore, most restorations with zirconia frameworks are fabricated by machining a porous or partially fired block of zirconia known as presintered zirconia. These are usually used as cores for crown or FDPs. In the presintered condition they are usually softer and easier to mill. They are milled to a slightly (20%) larger size, to compensate for the subsequent sintering shrinkage. Following milling they have to be sintered (called post sintering). Sintering is done in a furnace. Sintering time and temperature varies between brands.\\n- Sintering time – 6 to 7.5 hours\\n- Sintering temperature – 1350 to 1530 °C',\n",
       " '- Sintering time – 6 to 7.5 hours\\n- Sintering temperature – 1350 to 1530 °C\\nBecause of the high temperatures involved special furnaces are required for zirconia sintering. All grinding and adjustments should be completed prior to sintering. Adjustments following sintering especially in the connector areas weaken the structure. Any adjustments required after postsintering should be done with water cooled, vibration free, fine diamonds. The restoration may be immersed in special coloring liquid to improve the esthetics. The restoration is then built up with compatible veneering ceramics. Uses—core construction for crowns and long span anterior and posterior FDPs.\\n---\\nFurnaces are an important part of CAD/CAM dentistry. A variety of furnaces are available depending on the type of blank used. For example In-Ceram alumina blanks have to be glass infiltrated in a furnace following machining. Leucite or lithia disilicate blanks have to be cerammed to induce partial crystallization.\\n39 Sintered zirconia blanks (KAVO).\\nThe furnace for the sintering of zirconia is highly specialized as it involves very high temperatures. Zirconia sintering can involve temperatures greater than 1500 °C.\\nSome systems use a copy milling technique to produce ceramic cores or substructures for FDPs. In copy milling a wax pattern of the restoration is scanned and a replica is milled out of the ceramic blank (see Table 28.4 for comparison of CAD/CAM and copy milling).\\n1.

In this system impression is sent to a local Nobel licensed laboratory. Here the impression is poured and the conventional die is scanned by a contact scanner (Procera Forte - 44). The coping is designed (CAD) and together with the dimensions of the scanned die, the information is passed via internet to a fully automated industrial scale remote production facility which may be in another country. Here an enlarged die is milled via CAM process. The core is produced by dry pressing onto the die and is followed by sintering. The sintered copings are individually checked for quality control and shipped to the laboratory of origin where the subsequent veneering is completed. Thus in this system the laboratory needs to invest only in the scanner and the CAD software.\\n# 44\\nProcera contact scanner.

Zirconium oxide is a white crystalline oxide ceramic with unique properties. Its most naturally occurring form is the rare mineral, baddeleyite. A form of cubic zirconia is popularly used as a diamond simulant.',\n",
       " 'It has the highest strength among the dental ceramics because of its high degree of crack resistance. This is possible because of a unique property of zirconia to undergo a process known as transformation toughening. The stable form of zirconia is the monoclinic form. When zirconia is heated, it changes to its tetragonal high-temperature phase which again reverts back to the monoclinic form on cooling. However, addition of yttrium oxide (3–5%) also known as yttria maintains the zirconia in its high temperature tetragonal form at room temperature. Thus, this form of zirconia is known as ‘yttria-stabilized zirconia polycrystal’.\\nWhen a stress is applied to the zirconia as in the beginning of a crack formation, it reverts back to its monoclinic form locally with an accompanying increase in volume. The local increase in volume introduces compressive stresses around the crack and slows its growth. This is also known as ‘tension expansion’ - a phenomenon otherwise known only in the case of steel. For this reason zirconium oxide is also known as ‘ceramic steel’.\\nThe introduction of zirconia as a core material revolutionized dental ceramics. Its unique transformation toughening process made it possible to construct relatively long span fixed partial dentures in both anterior and posterior locations.\\n|Cubic zirconia|Baddeleyite|Zirconia powder|\\n|---|---|---|\\n|45A TO C|Various forms of zirconia| |\\n46 Representation of transformation toughening.

       " '---\\nThe addition of minor components to the zirconia, such as yttrium, can produce a crystal that is both strong and resistant to crack generation because of the unique “transformation toughening” that occurs when zirconia goes from a tetragonal phase to a monolithic phase. It is this monolithic phase of zirconia that is resistant to breakage when used in full-coverage restorations.\\n|Composition|Wt%|\\n|---|---|\\n|Zirconium dioxide (ZrO)2|90-92|\\n|Yttrium oxide (YO)2|3-5|\\n|Hafnium oxide (HfO)2|&lt; 3|\\n|Aluminum oxide (AlO)2|&lt; 0.25|\\n|Silicon dioxide (SiO)2|&lt; 1|\\nAvailable as blanks of different sizes and shapes.

However, when compared to other more translucent porcelains like lithium disilicate, zirconia appears less translucent and more opaque. Higher translucency will let more light into the restoration, and if used in conjunction with a clear cement, a more life-like appearance can often be achieved. The lower translucency is because of its higher crystalline content. When of equal thicknesses, the most translucent zirconia is only 73% as translucent as conventional lithium disilicate.|\\n---\\n47 Chipped veneering ceramic over a zirconia crown.\\ncooling may create stress in the porcelain, which could lead to cracking. Any surface adjustment, such as grinding, sandblasting, and even polishing, can change the phase on the surface of the zirconia and may affect the stability and strength of the zirconia as well as the veneer porcelain.\\nFracture of zirconia restorations Occasionally, total fracture of the zirconia core itself have been observed especially in the region of the second molars and over implants in the posterior region. Excessive or coarse grinding can cause cracks, which penetrate into the zirconia substructure, causing transformation that may initially hold these cracks closed. However, over time with exposure to the oral environment and reversal of the transformation stress, the cracks can begin to propagate. Furthermore, many of the “high-translucency zirconias” have low amounts of alumina, which is an important stabilizer. Lower amounts of alumina may cause excessive transformation, cracking, and tooth abrasion; however, clinical trials are expected to provide a more definitive answer.',\n",
       " 'Wear of opposing teeth Studies using natural teeth have shown that zirconia causes excessive wear of the natural tooth structure. Glazing alone is not sufficient as the glaze wears off exposing the rough surface underneath. Ongoing studies appear to show that polished zirconia is “wear-kind”. Therefore polishing, in addition to glazing is recommended currently to reduce wear of natural teeth.\\nCeria-stabilized zirconia-alumina nanocomposite (ZrO/AlO) (Ce-TZP/A) have recently become available and is even claimed to be superior to Y-TZP in clinical use.

Current porcelain systems have considerably improved in strength and toughness (Box 28.7). However, care still has to be taken during manufacture and fabrication of these materials to ensure that flaws that can lead to fracture are not incorporated. The strength of porcelain is usually measured in terms of flexure strength (or modulus of rupture).\\nFlexure strength It is a combination of compressive, tensile, as well as shear strength. The strength of various types of porcelains are given in Table 28.5. Flexure strength of dental ceramic restorations vary from 70 MPa for feldspathic veneering porcelains to 1200 MPa for machined zirconia core restorations.\\nTensile strength Porcelains are inherently brittle materials. Tensile strength is low because of the unavoidable surface defects like porosities and microscopic cracks. When porcelain is placed under tension, stress concentrates around these imperfections and can result in brittle fractures.\\n|Ceramic type|Flexure strength MPa|MOE GPa|CTE × 10–6/°C|Hardness VHN|Fracture toughness MPa.m1/2|\\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|\\n|PFM (VMK 68)|70|69|6.4–7.8| |0.7|\\n|Dicor|90–124| | | |1.2|\\n|IPS Empress|120–170|65|15–17|370|1.3|\\n|IPS Empress 2|350|95|9.7–10.6|400|3.3|\\n|In-ceram Alumina|500| | | |4.4–4.8|\\n|In-ceram Spinell|350| | | |2.7|\\n|In-ceram Zirconia|700| | | |6.8|\\n|Stabilized Zirconia|900–1200|210|10.5| |9|\\n---',\n",

Minute scratches, cracks, defects, porosity, etc., on the surface of the porcelain act as stress concentration points. When excessive tensile force or a sharp impact force is applied on the ceramic, the crack propagates through the crack tip until it penetrates through the entire thickness of the ceramic. This is the reason why surface glazing or polishing is important to eliminate as many of the surface defects as possible. The methods to improve the fracture resistance of ceramic materials are described.\\nThe method is to have layers of ceramic with slight differences in the coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE). The inner layer should have a slightly higher CTE than the outer layer. Thus on cooling to room temperature after firing the inner layer shrinks faster than the outer layer thereby pulling the outer layer inwards and creating compressive stresses within the outer layer. The principle is applied in both metal-ceramic restorations and all ceramic restorations where restorations are built up through layering. The inner metal coping usually has a higher CTE than the veneering ceramic. The innermost layers of ceramic like the opaquer will have a higher CTE than the enamel and dentin layers. Similarly in multilayered all ceramic restorations the inner core will have a higher CTE than the outer veneering ceramic. (However, one must remember that CTE differences should be precisely calculated. Extreme differences in CTE can actually lead to failure of the ceramic).',\n",
       " 'The method is used in the automobile industry to strengthen glass. Residual compressive stresses may be created by rapidly cooling the surface of the object while it is in the hot or molten state. The outer portions cools and forms a rigid skin while the inner portion is still hot. As the inner portion cools it shrinks and creates compressive stresses within the outer portion.\\nThe ion exchange process involves 2 ions with difference in size. When a ceramic object is placed in a bath of molten potassium salt, some of the sodium ions present in the surface glass is replaced by the potassium ions. The potassium ion is about 35% larger than the sodium ion. When the larger ion squeezes into the place formerly occupied by the smaller sodium ion large compressive stresses are created. The resulting compression leads to greater toughening of the glass than is possible by thermal strengthening. Glass thus treated is used in particular in the aircraft industry and other sectors where safety is all-important. The ion-exchange process is also sometimes referred to as chemical tempering. One commercially available product GC Tuf-Coat (GC) is used for chemical toughening. This potassium rich slurry is applied on the restoration and heated at 450 °C for 30 minutes in a furnace. However, the fracture resistance is confined to the surface of the glass to a thickness of just 100 μm.\\nMany of the modern glass based ceramics use dispersion strengthening. The process involves the dispersion of a crystalline material within the ceramic which interrupts the formation of a crack. The crack cannot pass as easily through the crystal particle as easily as it does through the glass matrix. Dispersion strengthening is dependent on the type, size, CTE and total content of the crystal within the ceramic. Examples of crystals used for dispersion strengthening are leucite, lithia disilicate, tetrasilic fluormica, alumina, spinell, zirconia, etc.',\n",
       " 'The transformation toughening phenomenon is primarily associated with yttria-stabilized zirconia core ceramics. The process involves stress-induced transformation of the material at the tip of the crack with accompanying volume expansion. This places the area at the tip of the crack under compression and thereby halts the progress of the crack. For further explanation see section on yttria stabilized zirconia.\\nEven the strongest ceramics can fail if the restoration is not designed properly. This includes sufficient thickness (at least 2 mm) for the ceramic, avoiding sharp internal line angles and point angles, avoiding marked changes in thickness, etc. Sharp angles or points on the internal surface of the restoration can act as stress raisers. Excessive thickness of porcelain in metal-ceramic restoration may lead to fracture because of insufficient support by the metal substructure. In the case of all-ceramic FDPs, the connector should have sufficient height and width. It should be concave and should avoid sharp angles.\\n---\\nceramics like zirconia and alumina. The inner coping also acts as a skin, reducing the formation and propagation of internal cracks. This function is evident is ceramics bonded to platinum or gold foil. The foils obviously do not provide the same kind of high strength support as seen in cast alloy copings but rather provides a protective inner skin that reduces internal defects.\\nThe ceramic can be made stronger by proper manipulation and fabrication. Proper condensation and vacuum firing reduces porosity in the restoration. Proper cooling reduces the development of internal stresses and strains. Manufacturers instructions should be followed. Proper oxidation firing favors bond formation in metal-ceramics.\\nShear strengp is low and is due to pe lack of ductility caused by pe complex structure of porcelain.',\n",

The CTE of the various layers should be closely matched. Extreme differences can induce a lot of stresses in the ceramic leading to immediate or subsequent failure. The CTE values range depending on the type of ceramic. Some of the veneering ceramics for metal-ceramic have value ranging from 6.4 to 7.8 × 10–6/°C, which is close to that of natural teeth.

A 4 minute exposure of feldspathic porcelain to 1.23% APF or 8% stannous fluoride resulted in surface roughness which may lead to subsequent staining. The acid attacks the glassy phase rather than the crystalline phases. Hydrofluoric acid is used to etch the porcelain. Ceramic etchants are also used for intraoral repair of fractured ceramic.|',\n",

Etching improves the bond of the resin to the ceramic. Etching is commonly done with hydrofluoric acid (51) or ammonium bifluoride (NHHF). The acid attacks and selectively dissolves the inner surface of the ceramic. The acid is available in two concentrations 5% and 9.5%. An etching time of 2 minutes is usually sufficient. Overetching can result in the formation of a white residue on the surface of the porcelain. This is believed to be a mix acid-reaction salts and crystal fragments. Following etching the restoration is cleaned by placing in ethanol followed by a 5 minute immersion in an ultrasonic bath. The tooth surface is also etched using phosphoric acid. Before placing the cement, a bond agent is applied to both surfaces (tooth and porcelain).\\nPrecautions: HF has the ability to readily penetrate skin tissues (often without causing an external burn), and cause extensive internal tissue damage, as well as alter blood calcium levels (due to the formation of CaF), which can lead to dangerous heart arrythmias.

For the bulk of the repair, a regular light-cured composite is used of the appropriate shade.

They have excellent biocompatibility and are more resistant to wear. Porcelain denture teeth also have the advantage of being the only type of denture teeth that allow the denture to be rebased. Porcelain teeth are made with high fusing porcelains. Two or more porcelains of different translucencies for each tooth are packed into metal molds and fired on large trays in high-temperature ovens.

Recent changes in coloration protocol for MZ restorations have seen the introduction of a three-zone coloring system and special effects stains. More translucent zirconia restorations have also been introduced.\\nMonolithic zirconia restorations begin as chalky white blocks (57A).

Queen Elizabeth I filled the holes in her mouth with cloth to improve her appearance in public. When dentures were installed, they were hand-carved and tied in place with silk threads. Retention of false teeth became more difficult as the number of teeth diminished in the mouth and those that wore full sets of dentures had to remove them before eating. Upper and lower plates fit poorly, and were held together by steel springs. Many including George Washington suffered from tooth loss and unfit dentures.\\n---\\n# 1 George Washington’s dentures\\n# 2 Ivory dentures inlaid with natural human teeth\\n# 3 18th century porcelain dentures retrieved from a grave in France\\n# 4 Metal denture base made from German silver which belonged to a soldier from the Battle of Shiloh 1862\\n# 5 1860 partial denture constructed from metal and vulcanite held by anchoring studs.

Rich people got dentures made of silver, gold, mother of pearl, or agate. In 1774, Duchateau and Dubois de Chemant designed a full set of dentures that would not rot (3). They were the first porcelain dentures. Giuseppangelo Fonzi created a single porcelain tooth held in place by a steel pin in 1808. Claudius Ash made an improved porcelain tooth in 1837. Porcelain dentures moved to the United States in the 1800s. They were marketed on a large scale. Porcelain dentures were prone to chip and also tended to appear too white to be convincing. Porcelain was tolerated by denture bearing mucosa but was difficult to fabricate and easily broken.',\n",
       " 'In the 1700s plaster of Paris was introduced as an impression material. It was used to make a mold of the patient’s mouth. This helped the shape of the dentures to be more precise. Swaged gold was used as denture base for those who could afford it. Other metals like German silver were also used as denture base (4). There was a real breakthrough when vulcanized rubber was discovered by Charles Goodyear in 1839 (5). This is a cheap, easy to work with material that could be shaped to fit the mouth and hold the denture. The casting machine was invented by Bean in 1870 and aluminum bases with teeth set in vulcanite were used. Vulcanite and other dental products were supplied in India under British rule primarily by the Bombay Burma Trading company which was set up in 1863 by the Wallace Brothers (6). After independence the company was taken over by the Wadia group, the dental branch of which continues today as the Dental Product of India (DPI). A little later plastics were introduced and celluloid and phenol formaldehyde resins were tried in place of rubber.

They become discolored and unesthetic and being thermosetting it is difficult to repair.\\n# POLYMERS\\nDenture base and other resins used in dentistry are made up of polymers. Therefore an understanding of the nature and chemistry of polymers is essential. Although work on synthetic polymers were started in the 18th century the nature of these unique materials were not clearly understood. In 1922 Hermann Staudinger (Germany) was the first to propose that polymers consisted of long chains of atoms held together by covalent bonds. He also proposed to name these compounds macromolecules. Before that, scientists believed that polymers were clusters of small molecules (called colloids), without definite molecular weights, held together by an unknown force.',\n",
       " '# NATURE OF POLYMERS\\n---\\n# repeating chemical structural unit from which the polymer is composed\\ne.g. poly (methyl methacrylate) is a polymer having chemical structural units derived from methyl methacrylate.\\n# MONOMER\\nThe molecules from which the polymer is constructed are called monomers (one part). Polymer molecules may be prepared from a mixture of different types of monomers and they are called copolymers.\\n# MOLECULAR WEIGHT\\nThe molecular weight of the polymer molecule equals the molecular weight of the various mers multiplied by the number of mer units. They may range from thousands to millions of units depending on preparation conditions. The molecular weight of polymers plays an important role in determining its physical properties. The average molecular weight for various denture polymers range from 8000 to 39000. Cross-linked resin teeth may have weights in excess of 600,000.\\n# DEGREE OF POLYMERIZATION\\nDefined as total number of mers in a polymer.\\n- The higher the molecular weight of the polymer made from a single monomer, the higher the degree of polymerization.\\n- The strength of the resin increases with increase in the degree of polymerization until a certain molecular weight is reached. Above this there is no change.\\n# MOLECULAR WEIGHT DISTRIBUTION\\nA narrow molecular weight distribution gives the most useful polymers. However most polymers have a wide range of molecular weights and so vary widely in their properties, e.g. the higher the molecular weight, the higher the softening and melting points and the stiffer the plastic.\\n# STRUCTURE OF POLYMERS (SPATIAL STRUCTURE)\\nThe physical structure of the polymer molecule is also important in determining the properties of the polymer. There are three basic structures.\\n# LINEAR\\n|Linear homopolymer|It has mer units of the same type.|\\n|---|---|\\n|Random copolymer| |\\n|Block copolymer| |\\n---\\n# 9 Structure of branched polymers.\\n|Branched homopolymer|Branched random|Branched graft|\\n|---|---|---|',\n",

Polymerization is a repetitive intermolecular reaction that is capable of proceeding indefinitely.\\n# TYPES\\nMost polymerization reactions fall into two basic types.\\n# Condensation polymerization (step growth)\\n1. Those in    which    polymerization      is accompanied        by  repeated     elimination of     small molecules,     i.e. the primary     compounds        react   with   the  formation     of  byproducts such as water,     halogen acids, and ammonia. The process can                repeat itself and form macromolecules.',\n",
       " '2. Those in which functional groups are repeated in the polymer chains. The mers are joined by functional groups (like amide, urethane, ester or sulfide linkages). Formation of a by-product is not necessary, e.g. polyurethane.\\nIn the past several condensation resins have been used to make denture bases. At present, condensation resins are not widely used in dentistry.\\n# Addition polymerization\\nMost   resins   employed       extensively     in dental    procedures are       produced      by addition polymerization. Here, there is no change in chemical composition and no by-products are formed. In this type of polymer, the structure of the monomer is repeated many times in the polymer. Starting from an active center, one molecule at a time is added and a chain rapidly builds up, which can grow almost indefinitely as long as the supply of building blocks is available.\\n# CHEMICAL STAGES OF POLYMERIZATION\\n# Induction\\n---\\n16000-29000 calories per mol in the liquid phase.\\n|Heat activation|Most denture base resins are polymerized by this method, e.g. the free radicals liberated by heating benzoyl peroxide will initiate the polymerization of methyl methacrylate monomer.|\\n|---|---|\\n|Chemical activation|This system consists of at least two reactants, when mixed they undergo chemical reaction and liberate free radicals, e.g. the use of benzoyl peroxide and an aromatic amine (dimethyl-p-toluidine) in self-cured dental resins.|\\n|Light activation|In this system, photons of light energy activate the initiator to generate free radicals, e.g. camphorquinone and an amine will react to form free radicals, when they are irradiated with visible light.|\\nOnce the growth has started only 5000 to 8000 calories per mole are required, the process continues rapidly and is accompanied by evolution of heat.\\nTheoretically, the chain reactions should continue with evolution of heat until all the monomer has been changed to polymer. In reality however, the polymerization is never complete.',\n",
       " \"Theoretically, the chain reactions should continue with evolution of heat until all the monomer has been changed to polymer. In reality however, the polymerization is never complete.\\nThe chain reactions can be terminated either by direct coupling of two chain ends or by exchange of a hydrogen atom from one growing chain to another.\\nThe chain termination can also result from chain transfer. Here the active state is transferred from an activated radical to an inactive molecule and a new nucleus of growth is created. An already terminated chain can be reactivated by chain transfer resulting in continued growth.\\n|Inhibitors|These react with the activated initiator or any activated nucleus, or with an activated growing chain to prevent further growth, e.g. hydroquinone (0.006%) is added to prevent polymerization of the monomer during storage.|\\n|---|---|\\n|Oxygen|Presence of oxygen (air) also inhibit polymerization.|\\nThe macromolecule may be formed by polymerization of a single type of structural unit. However, in order to improve the physical properties, it is often advantageous to use two or more chemically different monomers as starting materials. The polymers thus formed may contain units of these monomers. Such a polymer is called a copolymer and its process of formation is known as copolymerization.\\n---\\n# 11 Types of copolymers\\n|Random type|In random type of copolymer the different mers are randomly distributed along the chain, such as|\\n|---|---|\\n| |M - M - M - M - Y - M - Y - M - Y - Y - M - M -|\\n|Block type|In a block copolymer, identical monomer units occur in relatively long sequences along the main polymer chain.|\\n|---|---|\\n| |... - M - M - M - M - ... - M - M - Y - Y - Y - ... - Y - Y - M - M - ...|\\n|Graft type|In graft copolymers, sequence of one of the monomers are grafted onto the 'backbone' of the second monomer species.|\\n|---|---|\\n| |M - M - M - M - M - ... - M - M - M - M|\\n| |: : Y Y : : Y Y|\",\n",

Many useful resins are manufactured by copolymerization.\\n- Small amounts of ethyl acrylate may be copolymerized with methyl methacrylate to alter the flexibility.\\n- Block and graft polymers show improved impact strength. In small amounts they modify the adhesive properties of resins as well as their surface characteristics.\\nThe formation of chemical bonds or bridges between the polymer chains is referred to as cross-linking.

It is not so widely used as it may evaporate or leach out during normal use of the resin.\\n2. Internal - Here, the plasticizing agent is part of the polymer.

Originally they were laboratory nuisances - waxy, sticky residues left after certain organic reactions. These resinous materials composed of giant molecules attracted the attention of chemists giving rise to the field of plastics. Synthetic plastics are nonmetallic compounds which are molded into various forms and then hardened for commercial use (e.g. clothing, electronic equipment, building materials and household appliances). These materials are composed of polymers or complex molecules of high molecular weight. A variety of resins are used in dentistry. These include acrylics, polycarbonates, vinyl resins, polyurethanes, styrene, cyanoacrylates, epoxy resins, etc.\\n# CLASSIFICATION OF RESINS\\n- Thermoplastic\\n- Thermosetting\\n# Thermoplastic\\nThese are resins that can be repeatedly softened and molded under heat and pressure without any chemical change occurring.

The structure to be created (in this case a denture) is first constructed in wax. The wax portions will be replaced later with acrylic.\\n# Preparation of the split mold\\nThe waxed denture is invested in a dental flask with dental stone or plaster (also called flasking) using a 3 pour technique. After the stone or plaster sets, it is dewaxed by placing the flask in boiling water for not more than 5 minutes. After dewaxing, the two halves of the flask are separated, and the molten wax is flushed out with clean hot water. Removal of the wax leaves us with an empty space or mold into which soft acrylic is packed. Acrylic replaces the wax, assuming the shape of the final denture.\\n# Application of separating medium\\nThe resin must not contact the gypsum surface while curing.\\n1.

The mass is sticky and stringy (cobweb like) when touched or pulled apart.\\nAs the monomer diffuses into the polymer, it becomes smooth and dough like. It does not adhere to the walls of the jar. It consists of undissolved polymer particles suspended in a plastic matrix of monomer and dissolved polymer.

No. 12, the dough should be moldable for at least 5 minutes).\\nThe working time is affected by temperature.

Delayed packing may result in movement or fracture of the teeth, loss of detail and increase in the vertical height of the denture.\\nThe acrylic dough is packed into the flask in slight excess. The excess is removed during trial packing with a damp cellophane or polyethylene film used as a separator for the upper half of the flask. A hydraulic or mechanical press may be used to apply pressure. The closing force is applied slowly during the trial packing to allow the excess dough, known as ‘flash’, to flow out between the halves of the flask. The flask is opened and the flash is trimmed away. Before final closure, the separating film is removed and discarded. The final closure of the flask or metal to metal contact of the flask halves is then completed in the press. The flasks are then transferred to a holding clamp which maintains the pressure throughout the curing process.\\nAfter final closure the flasks are kept at room temperature for 30 to 60 minutes (sometimes called ‘bench curing’).\\n1. Permits an equalization of pressures throughout the mold.\\n2. It allows time for a more uniform dispersion of monomer throughout the mass of dough.\\n3.

Short cycle - 74 °C for 2 hours, then boil for 1 hour of the thinner portions (short cycle).\\nCooling: The flask should be cooled slowly, i.e. bench cooled. Fast cooling can result in warpage of the denture due to differential thermal contraction of the resin and gypsum mold. Cooling overnight is ideal. However, bench cooling it for 30 minutes and then placing it in cold tap water for 15 minutes is satisfactory.\\nDeflasking: The cured acrylic denture is retrieved from the flask. This is called deflasking. The flask is opened and the mold is retrieved. The mold separates quickly, because the surrounding plaster was poured in layers (3 pour technique). Plaster cutting forceps may be used to break-up the plaster. Deflasking has to be done with great care to avoid flexing and breaking of the acrylic denture.\\nFinishing and polishing: The denture is smoothened using progressive grades of sandpaper.

The processing shrinkage is balanced by the expansion due to water sorption.\\n- Thermal shrinkage on cooling\\n- Polymerization shrinkage\\nDuring polymerization, the density of the monomer changes from 0.94 gm/cc to 1.19 gm/cc. This results in shrinkage in the volume of monomer-polymer dough. However, in spite of the high shrinkage, the fit of the denture is not affected because the shrinkage is uniformly distributed over all surfaces of the denture.

However, repeated wetting and drying should be avoided as it may cause warpage of the denture.\\n---\\nAcrylic is virtually insoluble in water and oral fluids. They are soluble in ketones, esters and aromatic and chlorinated hydrocarbons, e.g. chloroform and acetone. Alcohol causes crazing in some resins.

However, above this temperature, i.e. between 125 °C and 200 °C it begins to depolymerize. At 450 °C, 90% of the polymer will depolymerize to monomer.\\nCoefficient of thermal expansion These materials have a high coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE). The CTE for poly(methylmethacrylate) resin is 81 × 10-6/ °C. Addition of fillers reduces the CTE.\\nHeat distortion temperature This is the measure of the ability of a plastic to resist dimensional change when loaded under heat. It is measured by observing the temperature at which a specimen under a 1.8 MPa load deflects 0.25 mm. Heat distortion temperature for PMMA - 71 to 91 °C. Heat distortion temperature for vinyl resin - 54 to 77 °C. Distortion is of concern during procedures like repair or polishing of dentures. Temperatures should be kept low to avoid distortion.\\nColor stability Heat-cured acrylic resins have good color stability.

Adhesion to metal or ceramic can be improved by treating with silane coupling agents.\\nThere have been instances of broken pieces of dentures being aspirated or swallowed. Radiopacity is a desirable property to enable easy location of the fragments. Most denture base materials are radiolucent. However a few radiopaque materials are being manufactured.\\nRadiopacity is obtained by the inclusion of heavy metal salts like bismuth or uranyl at concentrations of 10 to 15%.\\nAcrylic resins dispensed as powder/liquid have the best shelf life.

External porosity.\\nInternal porosity appears as voids or bubbles within the mass of the polymerized acrylic. It is usually not present on the surface of the denture. It is confined to the thick portions of the denture base and it may not occur uniformly.\\nCause Internal porosity is due to the vaporization of monomer when the temperature of the resin increases above the boiling point of monomer (100.8 °C) or very low molecular weight polymers. Exothermic heat of the surface resin dissipates easily into the investing plaster.',\n",

This localized shrinkage results in voids. The resin appears white.\\n- Avoided by Using proper powder/liquid ratio and mixing it well. The mix is more homogenous in the dough stage, so packing should be done in the dough stage.\\n- Lack of adequate pressure\\n- Lack of pressure during polymerization or inadequate amount of dough in the mold during final closure causes bubbles which are not spherical. The resin is lighter in color (34).\\n- Avoided by Using the required amount of dough. Check for excess or flash during trail closure. Flash indicates adequate material.\\nCrazing is formation of surface cracks on the denture base resin (35). The cracks may be microscopic or macroscopic in size. In some cases it has a hazy or foggy appearance rather than cracks. Crazing weakens the resin and reduces the esthetic qualities. The cracks formed can cause fracture.\\nIn poly (methyl methacrylate) crazing occurs when tensile stresses are present. The cracks are at right angles to the direction of tensile stress. Crazing is a mechanical separation of the polymer chains or groups under tensile stress. Crazing is visible around the porcelain teeth in the denture and is due to the contraction of the resin around the porcelain teeth during cooling after processing. Weak solvents like alcohol result in randomly placed cracks. Water incorporation during processing will form stresses due to evaporation of water after processing, causing crazing.\\n|34|Surface and subsurface porosity from lack of insufficient pressure during curing.|\\n|---|---|\\n|35|Representation of crazing in resins.|\\n---\\n- During polishing, a rise in temperature can cause warpage',\n",

Nose, ears, eyes or any other part of the head and neck may be reconstructed by these prostheses. They are also used in the movie industry for special effects. Ancient Chinese and Egyptians used waxes and resins to reconstruct missing portions of the face and head.\\nSince the 1500 CE when facial prostheses were described by French surgeon Ambrose Pare (1575), they have evolved from prosthesis made from gold, silver, paper, cloth, leather, wrought metals, ceramics and vulcanite. Modern maxillofacial prosthetics saw a resurgence after world war due to severe nature of the war related injuries. In spite of the advances in techniques and materials there is still a lot of scope for further development in this field.\\n1. These materials must be biocompatible, easy and inexpensive to fabricate, strong and durable.\\n2. The prosthesis must be skin-like in appearance and texture.\\n1: Pre- and post-treatment photos of an orbital prosthesis.\\n---\\n# Nasal prosthesis\\n# Orbital prosthesis\\n# Auricular prosthesis\\n2 Different types of maxillofacial prostheses. Notice the transparent feathered edges that aid in blending the prosthesis to the face.\\n1. It must be color stable as it is subjected to sunlight (including ultraviolet light) heat, and cold.\\n2. It must be easy to clean and manage by the patient.\\n3. Facial prostheses are often constructed with thin margins to enable blending to the skin. This is then attached to the skin with adhesives. On removing at night, the thin edges can tear. It must be resilient enough to prevent tearing.',\n",
       " '4. The water absorption of the prosthetic material is important since facial prostheses may absorb saliva or sweat from surrounding facial tissue. During washing, the prosthesis can absorb water. Any absorbed water may affect the physical properties and also affect the perception of color matching to the surrounding facial tissue.\\n5. It should be hygienic and prevent growth of microorganisms.\\n6. It should have translucent properties of the part it is replacing.\\nNo material so far has all of these characteristics.\\n# Evolution of maxillofacial materials\\n|Poly (methyl methacrylate) (1940–1960)|It was once commonly used for maxillofacial prosthesis. It is readily available, easy to manipulate, strong, color stable, hygienic and durable. Its usefulness in extra-oral prosthesis is limited because acrylic is hard and heavy, does not move when the face moves and does not have the feel of skin. Particularly used in cases where there is least movement of tissue bed during function.|\\n|---|---|\\n|Latexes|Latexes are soft, inexpensive and easy to manipulate. They are realistic and form lifelike prostheses. However, the finished product is weak, degenerates rapidly with age and changes color. Latex is no longer a major facial prosthetic material.|\\n|Plasticized Polyvinyl chloride|Polyvinyl chloride is a rigid plastic and is made more flexible by adding a plasticizer. Other ingredients added to polyvinyl chloride include cross-linking against (for strength) and ultraviolet stabilizers (for color stability). Color pigments can be incorporated to match individual skin tones.|\\n---\\nIt is supplied as finely divided polyvinyl chloride particles suspended in a solvent. When the fluid is heated above a critical temperature, the polyvinyl chloride dissolves in the solvent. When the mix is cooled, an elastic solid is formed. The prosthesis becomes hard with age because the plasticizers are lost from the surface of the prosthesis.',\n",
       " 'This material was introduced in the 1970s and 1980s as an alternative to silicone. Processing involves high heat curing pigmented sheets in metal molds. Dow chemicals’ chlorinated polyethylene elastomer is an industrial grade thermoplastic elastomer. It is less irritating to the mucosa than silicone, less toxic than thermosetting silicone materials and noncarcinogenic. Chlorinated polyethylene elastomer appears to be a suitable substitute for silicones for the fabrication of extraoral maxillofacial prosthesis in situations where cost of silicone is prohibitive.\\nIt is the most recent addition. One of its components is acrylate, which needs careful handling to prevent a toxic reaction to the operator. Although the material is cured at room temperature, it requires accurate temperature control because a slight change in temperature can alter the chemical reaction. A metal mold is used to avoid moisture in the air affecting the processing. It has lifelike feel and appearance and the color stability is better than that of polyvinyl chloride. But it is susceptible to deterioration with time.\\nSilicones were introduced as a maxillofacial material in the 1950s. Currently silicone based maxillofacial materials are the most widely used. Based on curing mechanism, two types of silicone rubber are available. Both types are widely used.\\n- RTV – Room Temperature Vulcanized\\n- HTV – Heat Vulcanized Silicones\\nBoth HTV and RTV silicones are available as fluid, semisolid, gel-like or putty-like material. They are generally supplied as clear or translucent materials though occasionally they may be supplied pre-pigmented (e.g. flesh colored - 2009 by Factor II). They are usually provided as base and catalyst where the base-catalyst ratio is 10:1. However base-catalyst ratio of 1:1 is also available.',\n",
       " 'Room vulcanizing silicones are available as fluid, semisolid or putty-like material. They may be transparent or translucent. The prosthesis can be easily fabricated in the dental laboratory with little special equipment using RTV silicones. However, such silicones are not as strong as the heat-vulcanized silicones and the intrinsic color is monochromatic.\\n2.

Optimal room temperature for curing is around 25 °C. Very high temperatures and humidity reduce working time. Lower temperatures also not recommended (below 20 °C) as it can cause retardation of setting and affect the properties.\\nHeat vulcanizing silicone is available as semisolid or putty-like material. They are supplied as a two-component system—a base (vinyl and hydride containing siloxanes) and catalyst (chloroplatinic acid catalyst) (4).\\nCommercial examples: Cosmesil M511, Nusil, Factor II, TechSil S25, etc.\\nFabrication involves milling, packing under pressure and curing. Pigments are milled into the material for intrinsic coloring. This is the material of choice, particularly in terms of strength and color stability. The coloring procedure is faster. Both intrinsic and extrinsic stains can be used making it polychromatic.\\nOne current silicone (Cosmesil M511) has a working time of approximately 1 hour and curing time approximately 1 hour at 100 °C.\\nBetter strength and color stability.\\nMilling machine and press is required.

       " '- Polyvinyl siloxane is the most successful maxillofacial prosthetic material till date and new advances are being made to this material to overcome their weaknesses.\\n- Silicones became more popular over other materials for the following reasons:\\n1.

High degree of chemical inertness.\\n4. Low degree of toxicity.\\n5. High degree of thermal and oxidative stability.\\n6. They can be stained intrinsically and/or extrinsically to give them a more life-like natural appearance.\\n7. When adequately cured, silicones elastomers resist absorbing organic materials that lead to bacterial growth and so with simple cleaning these materials are relatively safe and sanitary compared to other materials.\\n# Disadvantages of Maxillofacial Silicones\\n1. Susceptible to fungus growth.\\n2. Susceptible to fraying at the edges.\\n# 3D Printed Maxillofacial Prostheses\\nConventional maxillofacial prostheses are incredibly laborious and expensive to produce can take up to 10 weeks to complete. The process involves taking an impression from the area of trauma, casting a plaster positive, then making a mould, carving the desired form in wax, and finally casting in silicone. The end-result of this handmade process is normally expensive ranging between £1,500 to £3,000.',\n",
       " 'Among others, Sheffield-based Fripp Design has developed a system for fast and low-cost manufacture of facial prostheses such as nose and ear replacements for accident victims. Working with researchers at the University of Sheffield, the company developed a process that can print a customized nose or ear within 48 hours. First the patient’s face is 3D-scanned, then the specific contours are added to a digital model of the new prosthetic part for a perfect fit. These features are either taken from the scan of the patients’ relatives or the patient’s own file, for example, one ear can be scanned and mirrored to replicate another. Work is also in progress on 3D-printed eyes. A handmade eye can cost between $1800 to $8300, but a 3D printed one will only cost around $160. The parts are printed in full color in starch powder using a Z Corp Z510 color 3D printer. The lightweight model is then vacuum-infiltrated with medical grade silicone, binding it together. The cost of making such a part is almost the same as a handmade prosthetic, but Fripp says once the file is created, it can be used infinitely and the cost can be lowered to £150. The main barrier is the high cost of 3D scanning technology as well as getting approval from the health authority.\\n# 3D Bioprinting\\n---\\n# 8 3D printed nasal prostheses\\nBioprinting—the medical application of 3D printing to produce living tissue and organs is rapidly advancing.',\n",

San Diego medical research company Organovo announced last year it had created slices of functioning, long-lasting human liver which can survive for 40 days, using a 3D printer. Dr Faiz Y Bhora, Director of Thoracic Surgical Oncology at the St Luke’s-Roosevelt Hospital Center in New York, focuses his work on producing 3D printed tracheas from completely biologic materials primed with stem cells for growth.\\nBioengineering involves the creation of scaffolds on which the tissues can grow. The scaffolds must meet some specific requirements. A high porosity and an adequate pore size are necessary to facilitate cell seeding and diffusion throughout the whole structure of both cells and nutrients. Biodegradability is often an essential factor since scaffolds should preferably be absorbed by the surrounding tissues without the necessity of a surgical removal.\\nA commonly used synthetic material is polylactic acid (PLA). This is a polyester which degrades within the human body to form lactic acid, a naturally occurring chemical which is easily removed from the body. Other materials are polyglycolic acid (PGA) and polycaprolactone (PCL).',\n",
       " 'Scaffolds may also be constructed from natural materials. Derivatives of the extracellular matrix have been studied to evaluate their ability to support cell growth. Proteic materials such as collagen or fibrin and polysaccharides like chitosan or glycosaminoglycans (GAGs), have all proved suitable in terms of cell compatibility, but some issues with potential immunogenicity still remain. Among GAGs hyaluronic acid, possibly in combination with cross-linking agents (e.g. glutaraldehyde, water soluble carbodiimide, etc.) is one of the possible choices as scaffold material. Another form of scaffold under investigation is decellularised tissue extracts whereby, the remaining cellular remnants/extracellular matrices act as the scaffold.\\nProblems to overcome in the field of bioengineering remain problems with revascularization and debate on the ethical ramifications (see also chapter on additive manufacturing).\\n---\\n# Appendices\\n# Appendix 1 ADA/ANSI Specifications\\n|ADA Sp.
