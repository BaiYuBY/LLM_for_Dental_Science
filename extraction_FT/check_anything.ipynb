      "[\"\\nA second mechanism of protection from caries is the incorporation of fluoride into bacterial biofilms where it inhibits enolase. Enolase catalyzes the production of phosphoenolpyruvate, the precursor of lactate in glycolysis, from 2-phosphoglycerate during glycolysis (7 – see also  In addition, oral bacterial uptake of mono- and disaccharides mostly utilizes the phosphoenolpyruvate transport system to transfer them into the cytosol (Sect. 15.2.2). Fluoride therefore inhibits not only lactic acid production, but also the phosphoenolpyruvate transport system-mediated uptake of saccharide substrates. In short, fluoride inhibits saccharolytic fermentation by many oral bacteria. Although high levels of fluoride (<3,000 ppm) kill most bacteria, there is little evidence that common levels of fluoride (1–10 ppm) alter the types of bacterial species or their relative concentrations in biofilms. Mutans and other streptococci in the biofilm may switch to asaccharolytic fermentation (Sect. 1.3.2). A fluoride-mediated reduction in bacterial acid production, ensues without a detectable change in bacterial biofilm composition. Correspondingly, fluoride has no effect on the development of gingivitis or its progression to periodontitis. NOTE: Studies in the 1980s determined that large doses of fluoride do not protect from osteoporosis (Sect. 10.2.3), or decrease the incidence of bone fractures. It appears that increased fluoride in the diet inhibits osteoblast activity more than osteoclast activity; women on fluoride supplements suffer from more bone fractures, not less. Fluoride therapy for osteoporosis was popular in the 1980s, but the reports published after 1990 reduced enthusiasm for this treatment and it is not now recommended for post-menopausal bone loss.\\nentities: [{'id_name': 1119, 'type_name': 'prevention', 'test_name': 'incorporation of fluoride into bacterial biofilms'}, {'id_name': 1120, 'type_name': 'disease', 'test_name': 'caries'}, {'id_name': 1121, 'type_name': 'materials', 'test_name': 'Fluoride'}, {'id_name': 1122, 'type_name': 'description', 'test_name': 'inhibits not only lactic acid production, but also the phosphoenolpyruvate transport system-mediated uptake of saccharide substrates.

Levine, Topics in Dental Biochemistry, 285 DOI: 10.1007/978-3-540-88116-2_16, © Springer Verlag-Berlin Heidelberg 2011\\nHow Mottled Enamel Relates to Fluoride in the Water Supply\\n\\nThe studies that identified fluoride in the water supply eventually led to its use in caries prevention. These studies were mostly due to the extraordinary abilities of one man, Frederick Sumner McKay (1). McKay graduated in dentistry in Boston but in 1901, he moved to Colorado Springs because of health problems. There, mottled enamel was common and he soon became acquainted with this problem because many of his patients were seeking treatment for unsightly teeth due to mottling, not dental caries as in Boston. In 1908, McKay sent samples of mottled teeth to G. V. Black, Dean of the Northwestern University Dental School of Chicago, for advice. Beginning in 1916, he and Black published a number of reports in The Dental Cosmos, which later merged with the Journal of the American Dental Association. McKay outlined the geographic boundaries of the areas where mottled enamel was found, determined the percentage of afflicted individuals, and compiled evidence that pointed to the water supply as a cause. Black detailed histological studies that compared the enamel structure of mottled and normal teeth. Between 1925 and 1931, similar changes were described in the teeth of rats fed sodium fluoride in their diet, but these changes were not compared with Black’s description of mottled human enamel.\\nentities: [{'id_name': 1109, 'type_name': 'prevention', 'test_name': 'fluoride in the water supply'}, {'id_name': 1110, 'type_name': 'disease', 'test_name': 'caries'}]\\nrelations: [{'id_name': 403, 'type_name': 'prevent', 'entity1_name': 'fluoride in the water supply', 'entity1_type': 'prevention', 'entity2_name': 'caries', 'entity2_type': 'disease'}]\"]\n"
